"""orchestra.notify — snapshots in, notifications out.

The board already publishes a versioned `Snapshot` every time the composed view
changes (ENGINE.md §2.5, `observer.Observer`). This module is a CONSUMER of
that stream and of two sources beside it — the resume schedules and the
dispatch jobs, neither of which the observer watches. It does four things, in
order, and the order is the design:

  1. PROJECT the live world (a snapshot, the resume schedules, the dispatch
     jobs) down to exactly the fields a notification can turn on — `project`.
     Everything a notification could ever key on is here and nothing else is,
     so the diff below cannot be fooled by a stopwatch moving.
  2. DERIVE typed events by diffing two consecutive projections — `derive`.
     Pure, edge-triggered, no clock of its own beyond the timestamp it stamps.
     This is the LOSSLESS half: every edge becomes an `Event` and every `Event`
     is written to the `EventLog`, which the phone reconciles against on every
     foreground (API.md §9.22). Push can drop; this cannot.
  3. QUALITY CONTROL — `Notifier`. This is the half that decides whether push
     is tolerable or hateful: dedup (never twice for one condition), flap
     suppression (a status that blinks does not summon you), coalescing (three
     agents needing you is ONE notification), quiet hours in the device's own
     zone, and per-type preferences. A dropped push here is a decision, not a
     loss — the event is already in the log.
  4. COMPOSE the wire payload in orchestra's voice — `compose`. Terse, the
     board's own glyph vocabulary (● ▲ ⛔ ■ ◆ ○ ◇), and identifiers only: the
     prose is fetched by the phone's Notification Service Extension over the
     tailnet, never sent through Apple (UX.md §8.5 — "routing that same text
     through APNs would be a direct contradiction" of the no-public-exposure
     premise).

WHY A PROJECTION AND NOT THE SNAPSHOT ITSELF. Two reasons, both measured
elsewhere in this codebase. A card carries stopwatches (`cpu`, `etime`) that
move every second with nothing having happened — `observer._diffable` strips
them before the version diff for exactly this reason, and a notifier diffing
raw cards would fire on a resampled CPU percentage. And the things worth a
notification are not all IN the snapshot: a resume firing and a dispatch
landing are events in modules the observer does not watch, so the projection is
the one place all three join.

THE DIRECTION THAT IS DANGEROUS (METHOD.md §7). For a notification the
expensive error is the FALSE ALARM: a board that cries wolf gets its
notifications turned off at the OS level within a week, taking the P1 that
actually mattered with it. So every rule here fails toward SILENCE — an
unrecognised status emits nothing, a flapping session waits out its dwell, a
coalesced burst is one line, and the global budget drops the overflow into the
event log rather than onto the lock screen. Missing a your-turn by a sweep is
survivable; summoning the user to an agent that is mid-sentence is not.

# The board's glyphs, one per status, reused verbatim so a notification reads
# like a row of the board the user already knows (index.html `STATUS`). A title
# NEVER leads with one — VoiceOver speaks "up-pointing triangle" before every
# alert and a Braille display renders the raw codepoint, imposing a mandatory
# noise token on exactly the population the glyph serves (UX.md §8.5). The glyph
# lives in the SUBTITLE line, where the word beside it carries the meaning.

# Every event type, its tier, and its push defaults. Tiers are UX.md §8.4's, and
# they are the whole of "what makes push tolerable" before a single QC rule runs

# every turn, dozens of times a day, and pushing it is how a user disables
# notifications in week one.
#
#   level     — P1 (needs you now) · P2 (worth knowing) · P3 (quiet, no sound)

#               suppression: a status that blinks needs_input→working→needs
#               within the dwell fires once, not twice, and a your-turn that
#               the agent takes back (a long think mistaken for the prompt)
#               fires never. Wall-clock seconds, NEVER tick counts — the sweep
#               cadence varies 0.15–45 s and a tick count silently changes
#               meaning with it, slowest exactly when nobody is watching.

    It is fed one projection at a time by whoever owns the sweep — `observe`
    diffs against the last projection, writes every edge to the `EventLog`
    (lossless), and returns the events that SHOULD push after four gates, in
    this order because each depends on the last:

      1. PREFERENCE — the device turned this type off. (Cheapest, and it makes
         the rest moot.)
      2. DWELL / FLAP — the condition has not held long enough. A status that
         blinks needs_input→working→needs within the dwell never reaches push
         twice, and a your-turn the agent takes back never reaches it at all.
      3. COALESCE — three sessions crossing into needs_input in one sweep are
         ONE notification carrying a count, not three lock-screen lines.
      4. BUDGET / QUIET — the hourly ceiling, and the device's night. Both drop
         the push and keep the fact.

    DEDUP — "never twice for one condition" — is not a gate here; it is
    STRUCTURAL, and that is the stronger guarantee. A condition that HOLDS
    produces exactly one edge (`derive` skips an unchanged status), so a
    session parked at a question over fifty sweeps derives one event, not
    fifty. A condition RE-ENTERED is a genuinely new episode — a question
    answered and re-asked — and its session key carries a generation counter
    that makes it a distinct fact that SHOULD push again. A growing "already
    fired" set was the first design and it was quietly wrong in the one
    direction that matters: it would have permanently suppressed the SECOND
    time an account hit its limit or a worktree was freed, because those keys
    carry no generation and recur verbatim. Edge-triggering dedups the hold;
    the generation counter distinguishes the re-ask; a suppression set does
    neither job correctly and breaks the recurrence case. It is gone.

    A resolving edge (a session leaving needs_input) CANCELS a still-dwelling
    arm for that condition — that is the flap suppression, and it is why the
    notifier holds `_pending` rather than emitting on the raw edge.

    World-level work happens ONCE per sweep — derive, the durable log, the
    dwell/flap/coalesce QC — because the world is the same for every phone. Then
    the ready events fan out per device, and only the device-specific gates
    (that device's preferences, its quiet hours in its own zone, its budget,
    its APNs token) run per device. That split is why three phones do not
    triple the git work or the log, and why turning your_turn on for one phone
    does not turn it on for another.

    The sink is held LONG-LIVED and rebuilt only when the credentials in config
    change, so the moment the user drops a real `.p8` into place the very next
    event is a real push with no restart — and until then every phone gets a
    `NoopSink` that runs the whole pipeline and reports `no key`, which is
    exactly the state this project ships in. Rebuilding it every sweep, as an
    earlier cut did, threw away the sink's `healed_environment`, `last` and JWT
    warmth on every tick — a device on the wrong environment then paid two curl
    round trips forever. One shared `Backoff` lives here too, not per device: a
    429/503 is Apple's word about the SERVICE, and backing off one device while
    the others keep hammering earns a longer ban (push.Backoff's own docstring).

    It also owns the sleep/wake seam, because it owns the diff: a tick that
    arrives two minutes late is holding a `_prev` from before the lid closed,
    and diffing that against the world as found is a notification storm about
    3 a.m. See `_wake_gap` / `_on_wake` (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.3, §6.5).

        Two terms, because the platform is not consistent about which clock the

          * SKEW — `wall_d - mono_d`. The textbook signal, and the one
            ARCHITECTURE.md §4.3 writes: the wall clock ran on through the sleep
            while `time.monotonic()` froze, so the wall jumped and the monotonic
            barely advanced.
          * STALL — `min(wall_d, mono_d)`. ENGINE.md §4.5 measured the opposite
            on this machine — macOS `time.monotonic()` is `mach_absolute_time()`
            and INCLUDES sleep (644,530.1 s monotonic vs 644,524.9 s
            wall-since-boot over 179 hours), which `observer.Snapshot.mono`
            already records as a platform fact. Where that holds the skew is
            ~0 across a nine-hour sleep and a pure skew test would never fire at
            all. What is unmistakable on BOTH clocks is that a tick with a 30 s
            ceiling arrived two minutes late.

        Taking the max means the detector does not depend on which behaviour the
        host has, and neither term can be silently wrong: skew alone under-fires
        on macOS, stall alone would call a genuinely wedged sweep a sleep — but
        a sweep stalled past four times its own cadence has accumulated exactly
        the same staleness as a sleep, and the response to both (re-baseline,
        push nothing for two ticks) is the response you want either way.

        Measured tick-start to tick-start, so it is this loop's OWN cadence

        It reuses the RESTART baseline verbatim — `_baselined = False` — rather
        than carrying a second "am I stale" flag, because the two situations are
        the same situation: `_prev` describes a world that is hours old, and
        diffing it against the world as found produces a burst of edges nobody
        should be buzzed about (every account whose limit reset while the lid
        was shut, every session whose process is gone, every schedule whose
        `due_at` passed). One mechanism, one place to get it right.

        What it deliberately does NOT touch is the per-device `_pending` arms.
        Those are conditions ALREADY seen and dwelling — an agent that put a
        permission dialog on screen ten seconds before the lid closed — and they
        are still true when the lid opens because nothing ran in between. Their
        release is `_select`'s job on the first tick after the settle, which
        also cancels the ones the world no longer holds. Clearing them here
        would eat the one class of notification a wake must NOT lose.

        The `EventLog.epoch` is deliberately left alone too. It means "the ids
        you hold are gone" (a truncation or a sequence reset); a sleep truncates
        nothing and every `since` cursor a phone holds is still a valid position
        in the same total order. Bumping it would tell every phone to throw its
        cursor away and refetch for no reason. §6.5's "new epoch, resync all
