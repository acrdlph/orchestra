"""orchestra.resume — the keystroke a limit-stuck agent is waiting for.

A limit-stuck agent needs exactly one keystroke ("continue") typed at it once
its limit resets — but resets land at 3am, or days out on a weekly cap.
Arming a schedule hands that keystroke to the board: at the armed time it
verifies the limit really lifted (re-arming for the next reset if not), then
types the resume message into the session's own terminal — or, when no
terminal can be scripted (Cursor/VS Code, or the window is gone), relaunches
the conversation in a fleet tmux session via `claude --resume`.

Schedules survive both the browser and this server: every mutation is
persisted to resume.schedule.json, and pending entries whose time passed
while the server was down fire on the first loop pass after boot.

Unattended acting is the reason this module is paranoid where the manual
buttons are not. It never borrows another session's terminal — a 'continue'
typed at the wrong agent while nobody is watching is an injected instruction.
And the tmux fallback believes nothing it reads off the screen: a fat
transcript makes the reopened CLI reload and auto-compact for minutes, a
message pasted into either phase vanishes, and the bare composer it leaves
behind reads as delivered. So the only accepted receipt is the session file
itself gaining the message.

Top of the act layer, alongside finish: it imports observe (observer,
gitrepo, transcripts, limits) and act (terminal, dispatch), and nothing
imports it back except `server`. RESUME_STATE is rebound at runtime (tests
point it at a temp file), so it is deliberately NOT re-exported by the
facade — reach it as `resume.RESUME_STATE`.

    Each due schedule fires on its OWN short-lived daemon thread. Serially, one
    slow resume delayed every other one behind it — and `_tmux_resume` is slow
    BY DESIGN: `RESUME_READY_S` is seven minutes of waiting out a fat session's
    reload and auto-compaction, times three attempts. A weekly cap resets a
    whole fleet at the same instant, so "one at a time" is the case, not the
    corner.

    EXACTLY ONCE SURVIVES IT, and that is the only reason this is not a one-line
    map. Serial firing could not re-enter a key: the next pass did not start
    until the previous fire returned. Off-thread it can — five seconds later the
    same key is still `pending` and still due, and a second thread would start
    typing into an agent the first one is mid-paste with. That is the
    triple-send 1e7674b closed, arriving through another door.

    So a key is CLAIMED into `_firing` inside the SAME critical section that
    finds it due. Per key this stays strictly serial; only across keys is it
    parallel. `_fire_claimed` releases the claim in a `finally`.
