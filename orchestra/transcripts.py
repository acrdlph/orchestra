"""orchestra.transcripts — what the agents WROTE: Claude Code's .jsonl files.

Claude Code keeps one transcript per session under
`<home>/projects/<munged-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`, append-only, one JSON
object per line, with workflows and subagents writing into a sibling
`<session-id>/` directory. This module is the only place that knows that
shape. It finds the homes (multi-account setups included), reads a bounded
chunk off either end of a file — never the whole thing, transcripts run to
hundreds of megabytes — and turns the last few hundred kilobytes into the
handful of facts a card needs: topic, model, last thing said either way,
which tools are still unresolved.

`_clean` and `_real_prompt` are the filter between a transcript and a human
eye: strip ANSI and tags, collapse whitespace, and refuse the machine text
the harness injects (system reminders, command stubs, tool-use ids) so a card
never shows the plumbing back to you.

`scan_sessions` is the top of this file's stack and the join point of the
whole observe layer: it maps every recent session onto a worktree (gitrepo),
hands the per-worktree session list and process list to `procs` for pairing,
and asks `status` what each one MEANS. Everything is read-only — the board
opens transcripts, it never writes one.

`StatMemo` is what makes that affordable under a perpetual sweep: a transcript
is append-only, so a read of it is a pure function of `(dev, ino, size,
mtime_ns)` and can be reused verbatim until one of those four moves. It is the
one piece of state in this file, and it is state that cannot go stale — see the
comment on it for why that is a property of the key and not a hope, and for the
bound that keeps it from growing with the corpus.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- the memo
#
# What a sweep spends here, measured with getrusage(SELF)+(CHILDREN) over the
# real fleet — 9 worktrees, 539 transcripts under matched projects, 48 of them
# inside the 48 h window, 18,187 `.jsonl` under 1,071 subagent directories:
#
#   stage                              CPU     share
#   _subagent_files   (539 trees)    105 ms     54 %   <- 44 ms walk, 61 ms stat
#   parse_session_tail (48 files)     43 ms     22 %
#   find_last_user     (13 files)     27 ms     14 %
#   session_topic      (48 files)      6 ms      3 %
#   scan_sessions (whole)            196 ms
#
# Between two sweeps a second apart essentially none of that input changed. So
# every read here is keyed on the stat of what it read, and reused when the key
# is identical — ENGINE.md §4.3's stat memo, not §4.2's rejected byte offsets.
#
# TWO RULES, and they are the whole reason this is safe:
#
# * THE KEY CONTAINS EVERYTHING THAT CAN CHANGE THE ANSWER — everything a real
#   writer changes, at any rate; `StatMemo`'s docstring records exactly where
#   that stops being true and why the reconcile below bounds it. Size AND
#   mtime_ns, so an append is a miss; `(st_dev, st_ino)` and not just the path,
#   so a transcript that is rotated or replaced under its own name is a miss
#   too. That trap is not hypothetical: `_proven_in_transcript` kept a byte
#   offset with no identity check, a delivered message read as undelivered, and
#   an agent redid its work three times at 3x usage (ENGINE.md §4.2).
# * IT IS BOUNDED. The corpus grows ~982 `.jsonl`/day, so an unbounded map is a
#   leak with a multi-day uptime (§4.7). LRU cap plus an idle sweep, below.
#
# And it is audited: a cold sweep (RECONCILE_S, every 60 s) bypasses the memo,
# re-reads from the file, and counts any disagreement into `drift`. A memo
# nobody audits is worse than a slow sweep. Unlike the git cadence's drift —
# which is a measured cost, the cadence never claimed to be current — drift
# here is a LIE, and any non-zero `scan_drift`/`tree_drift` is a bug.
#
# After, same fleet: 196 -> 76 CPU-ms warm (2.6x), 98 % / 96 % hit rate. The
# cold reconcile costs 260 ms — a third more than an uncached scan, because it
# reads the directories twice to compare — once every 60 s, 0.4 % duty.

# Caps are sized off the per-sweep WORKING SET, not off a memory target: an LRU
# smaller than what one sweep touches thrashes to a 0 % hit rate and pays the
# extra stat for nothing. Overflow is graceful — it degrades to the behaviour
# this file had before the memo existed — but it is silent, so the caps are
# multiples of a measured working set, not round numbers.
#
# `_FACTS` holds one entry per transcript actually parsed: the in-window ones,
# 50 here (48 transcripts + 2 subagent reports). 2,048 is ~40x that; a fleet
# needing more has two thousand agents awake inside 48 hours.
#
# `_TREES` holds one entry per DIRECTORY under a session's subagent tree, and
# every session dir of every matched project is walked on every sweep — the
# walk is what rescues a session whose main transcript is out of window, see
# `_subagent_files` — so its working set is all 1,071 of them, not the 50.
# 4,096 is ~3.8x today's fleet and is §4.7's number.
#
# Measured, deep-sized, on that fleet: _FACTS 50 entries = 0.10 MB, _TREES
# 1,071 = 2.20 MB, i.e. ~2 KB per entry either way (a tree entry is the file
# NAMES of one directory; a facts entry is one card's worth of cleaned text).
# Both caps full would be ~12.6 MB, which is the number to argue with if these
# ever look generous.
MEMO_FILES = 2048
MEMO_DIRS = 4096

# Nothing outside the 48 h window is ever parsed again, and a session dir that
# stops being walked has had its worktree removed. An hour idle means neither
# will come back without a fresh stat anyway, so the entry is pure ballast.

class StatMemo:
    """A pure-function cache whose key is the stat of the thing it read.

    Not a model of the world and not a state machine: the value is a function
    of the bytes, and the key changes whenever the bytes can have. So it does
    not go stale — it is only ever evicted, and eviction costs one re-read.
    "Whenever the bytes can have" is doing real work in that sentence, and it
    is not free: see THE BOUNDARY below for the one write that changes the
    bytes without changing the key.

    `ident` is WHAT was read — `(path, st_dev, st_ino)`. Identity is in the
    ident so a rotated file misses; the path is in it too so a recycled inode
    at a different path cannot be mistaken for a hit. `key` is the part that
    moves — `(st_size, st_mtime_ns)`.

    THE BOUNDARY (ADR 0011). Four numbers decide a hit — `st_size`,
    `st_mtime_ns`, `st_dev`, `st_ino` — so a write that preserves ALL FOUR
    serves stale content: an in-place rewrite of the same byte count, on the
    same inode, with `os.utime(p, ns=…)` putting the nanosecond mtime back.
    Reproduced on disk, not argued from the key — see
    `test_the_boundary_an_in_place_rewrite_preserving_all_four_stats`, which
    exists to make this paragraph go red if the key ever gets stronger. Two
    things keep it a recorded boundary and not a bug:

    * It is adversarial, not realistic. Claude Code transcripts are appended
      to, never rewritten, so `st_size` moves on every real write. Nothing in
      this repo rewrites one; the failure needs a deliberate editor.
    * It is BOUNDED. The cold reconcile (config key `reconcile_s`, 60 s by
      default) bypasses this memo entirely, re-reads from the file, and counts
      a disagreement into `scan_drift`/`tree_drift`. So a defeated key costs at
      most one `reconcile_s` of stale text and is visible afterwards rather
      than silent — which
      is the entire difference between this and the byte-offset cache that let
      a delivered message read as undelivered (§4.2).

    Recorded because the boundary of a cache should be written down where the
    cache is, not discovered later by whoever is holding it. And note how the
    first attempt to demonstrate it FAILED and read as proof of safety:
    `os.utime` with float seconds cannot restore the nanosecond component
    (measured here: ...216723268 came back as ...216723203), so the key moved
    anyway and the memo correctly missed. A negative result from a test that
    could not have succeeded is not evidence — that one is pinned too, as
    `test_a_float_utime_cannot_restore_the_nanoseconds_it_truncated`.

    LOCKED, for the same reason `procs.ProcMemo` is. `scan_sessions` runs on
    the sweep thread AND on any HTTP thread whose `cached_state()` found a
    parked cache — which is every request immediately after a mutation, by
    design. Every method here is a read-then-mutate pair, and none of them is
    atomic: `get` does `_d.get(ident)` and then `move_to_end(ident)`, and
    `expire` does `next(iter(_d))` and then `del`. Reproduced, not theorised —
    four threads on this class raise `RuntimeError: OrderedDict mutated during
    iteration` out of `expire` and `KeyError` out of `get` within seconds. The
    window is narrow at MEMO_IDLE_S=3600 (`expire` almost always breaks on its
    first entry), which is exactly what makes it the kind of bug that ships:
    it surfaces as one 500 on the board, months apart, with no way to reproduce.

    Nothing expensive is ever called under the lock — `_read_facts` and the
    directory walks run outside it, between a `peek`/`get` and a `put`.

#
# `pendingWorkflowCount` / `pendingBackgroundAgentCount` ride the CLI's own
# end-of-turn record and are right when non-zero — but they are INCOMPLETE.
# Measured over the 154 end-of-turn claims of step 5: 23 saw the agent speak
# again with no human prompt in between, and on every one of those the two
# counts read 0 while a `<task-notification>` — a background task reporting
# back, which resumes the session — was what woke it. So the board's
# "delegated" guard has to be able to see the delegation itself.
#
# WHAT A BACKGROUND LAUNCH LOOKS LIKE ON DISK. Not the tool_use `input`:
# `run_in_background: true` is neither necessary nor sufficient. A foreground
# Bash that outruns its timeout is MOVED to the background by the harness (16
# of 485 notified Bash launches on this corpus arrived that way, with no
# `run_in_background` in the input at all), and 337 `Agent` calls that look
# identical in the input ran in the foreground and returned their report
# inline. What is decisive is the tool_RESULT, which the harness writes and
# which says so in words:
#
#   Bash      "Command running in background with ID: b3l1ahei … You will be
#              notified when it completes."
#   Bash      "Command did not complete within its 180s timeout and was moved
#              to the background (ID: bx1dek5dm). … You will be notified…"
#   Workflow  "Workflow launched in background. Task ID: w8oz82r5k"
#   Agent     "The agent is working in the background. You will be notified
#              automatically when it completes."
#   Monitor   "Monitor started (task b1h0ax9vj, persistent…). You will be
#              notified on each event."
#   SendMsg   "…resumed from transcript in the background with your message.
#              You'll be notified when it finishes."
#
# One phrase spans all six and is the actual contract — "you will be notified"
# is the harness promising to resume this session — so that is what is matched,
# rather than a list of tool names a future release would silently outgrow.
# Measured over 49,115 tool_use records in ~/.claude*: 2,069 results carry it
# (Bash 1,017, Workflow 541, Agent 442, Monitor 36, SendMessage 33), and no
# foreground result does.
#
# WHAT COMES BACK. A `<task-notification>` carrying BOTH `<tool-use-id>` and a
# terminal `<status>`. The pairing is exact, not heuristic: of 1,163 distinct
# tool-use-ids seen in notifications, 1,163 resolved to a tool_use in the
# corpus — 100 %.
#
# The `<status>` half is, on today's corpus, a SECOND LOCK ON THE SAME DOOR and
# is kept deliberately. What it is guarding against is real — a Monitor emits
# interim `<event>` notifications while it is still streaming, and reading one
# as "reported back" would drop the guard mid-stream — but those interim
# entries carry no `<tool-use-id>` either (397 of them, none with an id), so
# the id alone already excludes them. Measured: of 5,494 notifications carrying
# a tool-use-id, ZERO lack a terminal status (completed 5,065, failed 291,
# killed 81, stopped 4). It stays because the day an interim event gains an id
# is the day this guard fails silently, and the check costs one regex.
#
# The notification is written in three different shapes and all three must be
# read, which is why `_notification_texts` exists rather than a look at
# `message.content`: as a plain `user` entry (1,303), as a `queue-operation`
# with the text at top-level `content` (2,626 enqueue + 1,168 remove), and as
# an `attachment` whose text is at `attachment.prompt` (898).

    `all_procs`, not `procs`: the module object of that name is what the
    session↔process pairing now hangs off, and a parameter would shadow it.
    Callers pass it positionally, so the name is local knowledge.

    `cold` bypasses the stat memo (§4.3 #1): every transcript is re-read from
    the file and every directory re-scanned, and whatever the memo would have
    served is compared against the truth and counted into `drift`. Left False —
    which is every call but the reconcile sweep's — this reuses the parse of any
    transcript whose `(path, dev, ino, size, mtime_ns)` has not moved.

    `hooks` is `sid -> status`, ONE snapshot of the live hook edges taken by the
    caller before the scan starts (`hooks.HookEdges.live()`), or None for a
    fleet with no hooks installed — which is what every call outside the
    Observer passes, and what keeps `tests/characterize.py` reproducible. It is
    a plain dict rather than the store itself on purpose: this function walks
    every home and every project directory between its first session and its
    last, and taking the store's lock once per session would give a 300 ms scan
    eighty chances to stall a hook POST — i.e. to stall an AGENT, because Claude
    Code blocks on its hooks.

    Two conditional fields ride out of here when a hook was involved, both
    absent otherwise so an unhooked fleet's payload is byte-identical to before:
    `hooked` (a live edge exists for this session) and `status_src: "observed"`
    (…and what we are publishing is what it said). The pair is deliberate —
    `hooked` is about the SESSION and is what the board badges; `status_src` is
    about THIS ANSWER, and a hooked session whose hook was vetoed by the ladder
    is honestly `inferred`."""
