"""orchestra.config — where the board's settings come from, and what they are.

Precedence: CLI flags > orchestra.config.json (next to the package, else cwd)
> the defaults in CFG below. `load_config` is called once, from
`orchestra.__main__`, before anything else runs.

CFG is a mutable dict and is mutated in place, never rebound — every reader
holds the same object. DEMO and CONFIG_PATH are the opposite: plain scalars
that get REBOUND at runtime, so every reader must reach them as
`config.DEMO` / `config.CONFIG_PATH`. A `from .config import DEMO` anywhere
would freeze a copy and silently disable demo mode.

`account_label` lives here rather than with the transcript code (ADR 0010's
prose puts it there) because it is a four-line pure string function on a
home-dir name with no dependencies, called from six modules — a shared leaf.
Keeping it here is what makes config → procs → transcripts acyclic.

    #
    # It has to exist because 3.8 % of background launches never report at all
    # — 76 of 2,000 in ~/.claude* (Workflow 37, Bash 32, Agent 7), killed or

    # Chosen off both sides of the trade, measured by replaying every

    # ended and the agent then speaking again with no human prompt — the
    # flicker; "held" is the opposite error, a turn that really had ended kept
    # at WORKING by a launch that was never coming back:

    #     bound      uncaught misfire   held wrongly

    # latency (1,928 s; p50 278 s, p95 3,010 s) is not a contradiction: a task
    # still running after ten minutes is one whose session has other evidence
    # of work — an unresolved tool_use, a live shell, or a non-zero
    # pendingWorkflowCount — and every branch of those sits ABOVE this one.
    # Measured: of the 908 claims, no misfire had an outstanding launch older
    # than 450 s (p50 16 s, p90 692 s, p95 2,069 s).

    # waiting for is YOU". It inherited working_s because Layer 0 kept it
    # conservative; this is the first time it has been measured.
    #
    # Very little reaches it. `AskUserQuestion` is answered one branch above
    # (needs_input) and delegated work one above that — and, the big one, a
    # RUNNING Bash is answered by the `shells` branch, because the Bash tool
    # wraps every command in a live zsh child. A Bash awaiting APPROVAL has no
    # wrapper shell yet, and that asymmetry is what makes this branch worth
    # having at all. Under --dangerously-skip-permissions it is dead code:
    # 416 of 737 transcripts (56.4 %) never ran in a mode that can ask, and on
    # the board's own working set it is 78 of 96 (81.2 %).
    #
    # Measured by replaying every transcript and taking the SILENCE BETWEEN
    # CONSECUTIVE WRITES while a tool_use was unresolved — which is what `age`
    # actually is; a parallel tool call or a sidechain write resets it, so the
    # raw tool_use→tool_result span would have been the wrong distribution.
    # Split into the two populations this number trades:
    #
    #   flicker — the silence ended because the TOOL finished, so ■ BLOCKED
    #             is a false summons: 18,741 silences, p95 6.6 s, p99 63.0 s
    #             (in the sessions that CAN be asked: p95 10.6 s, p99 117.3 s)
    #   catch   — the silence ended because a HUMAN did: the tool_use resolves
    #             with "The user doesn't want to proceed…" / "User has
    #             approved your plan", or the tool is ExitPlanMode. 293 of

    # extra false alarms in 18,741 opportunities (+0.21 pp), and on the
    # board's own working set it is FREE — 5 false silences at 60 and 5 at 90

    # 26 s of promptness bought per extra false summons at 60, 20 s at 45,

    # inheritance that used to.
    #
    # What it claims to cover is the lag between a process EXISTING and
    # orchestra SEEING it. Driven at 40 ms resolution, 9 launches: the process
    # is in `procs.claude_processes()` with a resolved cwd 0.14–0.32 s after
    # exec, and the transcript's first byte does not land until 2.25–3.33 s.
    # A just-exec'd agent is therefore visible 2.1–3.0 s BEFORE it can appear
    # on the board at all, and needs no grace whatsoever. The probe does not
    # miss either: 0 unresolved cwds in 3,000 lsof calls, 0 short reads in 200
    # whole-table `claude_processes()` calls, and over 816 live board ticks
    # (27.2 min) 7,966 process observations without a single missing cwd and
    # 0 pairing flaps.
    #
    # So the measurable half of the question wants ~0, and the number's real
    # job is the half with no observed events: a probe that comes back empty.
    # Counterfactual over those same 816 ticks — 4,663 observations of a
    # session that WAS paired with a live pid, asking what ONE blind probe
    # would have published (a live session's transcript is 51 s old at a
    # random moment, p50; p75 405 s):
    #
    #      V      live sessions published ○ ENDED   worktrees gone FREE
    #     10 s               73.4 %             1,317 of 2,448  (5.5x)

    # below 90, and a guess in this direction is the one that puts two agents
    # on one worktree. It stays until evidence replaces the timer:
    # `classify_session` already takes `procs_known` for exactly this failure
    # and nothing passes it. The price of leaving it is known too — 89.2 s of

    # guess: past it, `classify_session` returns `unknown` (card stays busy, never
    # cries "needs you") instead of guessing the user's turn from hours-old bytes.
    # This only bites the pathological case — a live process whose OWN session
    # has no readable transcript, mis-paired to a done sibling (seen for real when
    # a full disk stopped a workflow-running session from writing its `.jsonl`).
    # Deliberately LARGE: an agent legitimately idle at the prompt for an hour is
    # still ◆ YOUR TURN, and only silence no live session ever really shows —
    # hours — is demoted. Six hours; raise it if you leave agents parked overnight.
    "stale_alive_s": 21600,

    # `subagent_grace_s` — how long after the last write anywhere under

    # inherited numbers, and the only one that was measurably TOO SHORT.
    #
    # It is a display hint and nothing else: `subagents_active` is read by one
    # line of index.html and feeds no status, no availability and no dispatch,
    # so neither error can put two agents on one worktree. What it can do is
    # flicker, and flicker is the thing this project spends numbers on.
    #
    # THE POPULATION IS NOT THE CONVERSATION'S. One `agent-*.jsonl` under the
    # tree is one subagent's whole life, so its first and last timestamps
    # bracket a span in which that subagent is definitely running. Measured
    # over ~/.claude* — 8 homes, 148 trees, 18,145 runs (32 multi-hour files
    # dropped: a resumed file, not one turn), 605,784 writes:

    #
    # An order of magnitude denser at the tail. A workflow agent writing
    # steadily looks nothing like a conversation, which is the whole reason
    # this could not go on borrowing `working_s`.
    #
    # But the gap distribution is the WRONG one to place a percentile in here,
    # and that is the interesting part. `quiet_s` gets one draw per chance to
    # misfire, because one misfire is one false summons. A subagent run is p50
    # 23 writes long (p90 67), so 0.18 % of silences reaching 90 s is 1 RUN IN

    # It has to exist because a dead peer is otherwise only discovered by
    # WRITING to it, and on a quiet fleet the next write is the keepalive —
