"""orchestra.pairing — how a token gets onto a phone without being typed.

Until now a device token was minted at a shell (`--add-device`), printed once,
and carried to the phone by hand. Forty-three base64 characters, typed into a
phone keyboard, exactly once, with no feedback if you get one wrong. That is not
a flow anybody completes twice, and a credential that is annoying to install is
a credential that gets pasted into a notes app.

## The shape, and why the QR does not carry the token

A short-lived **pairing code** is minted on the Mac and shown on the screen. The
phone presents it to `POST /api/v1/pair` and gets a device token back. The QR
carries the code, not the token.

That indirection is the entire security argument, so it is worth stating why it
is not paranoia. A QR on a screen is **visible to the room**. Somebody behind
you, a video call you forgot was sharing, a screenshot in a bug report, a photo
in a Slack thread six months from now — all of them capture whatever is in the
picture, permanently. A token in that picture is a permanent credential to a
server that can type into terminals running `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. A
pairing code in that picture is worthless 120 seconds later, and worthless
immediately if anybody has already used it.

So the properties are chosen against *that* photograph:

| property | why |
|---|---|
| **single use** | the first claim closes the window. A second phone with the same photo gets `pairing_not_open`, and — the part that matters — the user sees one device appear when they expected one |
| **120 s** | long enough to unlock a phone and open the camera, short enough that a photograph is stale before it is out of the room. It is also the number API.md §3 already specified |
| **the code is not the token** | claiming it mints a fresh 256-bit secret that was never on screen |
| **loopback or tailnet only** | a claim from anywhere else is refused before the code is even compared |
| **attempts are budgeted per IP** | 40 bits of code is not brute-forceable, but the budget is what stops the attempt log being flooded, and it is per-IP so one hostile peer cannot lock out the phone that is actually pairing |

## The code alphabet

Eight characters of **Crockford base32** — `0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ`,
which is the ordinary alphabet with `I`, `L`, `O` and `U` removed. That is 40
bits, and the removals are the point: this string has to survive being read off
a screen by a human when the camera does not work, and `I`/`1`, `O`/`0` and
`L`/`1` are where that goes wrong. `U` is dropped for a different reason, which
is that its presence makes accidental profanity possible.

Normalisation is symmetric and generous — strip spaces and dashes, uppercase,
then fold `I`→`1`, `L`→`1`, `O`→`0`, `U`→`V` — so `7k3m-9qp2` and `7K3M9QP2` and
`7K3M 9QP2` are the same code. It is generous about FORM and not at all generous
about VALUE: the comparison is `hmac.compare_digest` over sha256, never `==`.

## The state is in memory, and that is the design

The open window is a module global. It does not survive a restart, and it must
not: a pairing window is a temporarily open door, and a door that reopens by
itself when the server restarts is a door nobody closed. Restarting orchestra
closing every pairing window is the correct behaviour, not a limitation.

Consequently there is nothing to write and nothing to clean up — the only
persistent effect of a successful pairing is the device that `auth.add_device`
appends to the registry.

## What this module deliberately does not do

* **It does not decide who may OPEN a window.** That is `auth.check`'s job, and
  the answer is "this machine, holding no token" — see `auth.ADMIN`. A phone
  that could open a pairing window could pair a second phone.
* **It does not issue scopes.** ADR 0014 defers them whole; one token grants
  everything, and `tokens.read`/`tokens.act` in API.md §3.3 both being the same
  string today would be a lie about what has been built. The response carries a
  single `token`, and API.md says so.
