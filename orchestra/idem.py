"""orchestra.idem — persisted, boot-aware idempotency for wire mutations.

Wave 1 added in-memory resource locks (`dispatch._wt_reservations`,
`agent:<id>`), and they stop a concurrent double-tap cold. What they cannot
stop is a *retry that lands after the server restarted*. `./start.sh` kills and
relaunches this process by design, so restart-mid-dispatch is routine — and a
background `URLSession` defaults `timeoutIntervalForResource` to seven days and
retries across reboots and network changes. A dispatch handed to the phone's
background daemon during a tailnet outage can arrive forty minutes later
against a fresh process whose in-memory lock is long gone. It re-executes, and
a second agent launches on the same branch: two agents merging and pushing one
worktree, the worst outcome this product can produce (ARCHITECTURE §5.6).

The close is a reservation persisted **write-ahead** — at `begin()`, before the
caller's side effect — tagged with a per-process `BOOT_ID`. A retry that finds
its key still `in_flight` under a DIFFERENT boot is told the server restarted
mid-op (`operation_indeterminate`) and is NEVER re-executed; the same key under
the same boot is the ordinary concurrent duplicate (`operation_in_flight`); a
`done` key replays its stored response verbatim. There is deliberately no
`abandon()` — a handler exception settles the key with the failure, so the
retry replays the failure rather than re-running the side effect.

A leaf by construction: it imports `config` only (for the state-file path) and
nothing in the package imports it back except `server`, which wraps each keyed
mutation with `begin()`/`complete()`. `begin` releases this module's lock
BEFORE the handler runs — the handler takes its own worktree/pick locks, and
this lock is never held across it, so idempotency composes above the Wave 1
locks without a lock-ordering cycle. `IDEM_STORE` is rebound at runtime (tests
point it at a temp file), so it is reached as `idem.IDEM_STORE`, and `BOOT_ID`
likewise (a restart test swaps it), never copied to a caller.
