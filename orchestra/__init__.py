"""orchestra — local mission control for parallel Claude Code agents.

Watches your git worktrees, your Claude Code home directories (multi-account
setups included), and live `claude` processes; serves three views on
http://127.0.0.1:4242 — the board (who's working / who needs you / which
worktree is free), the map (real git topology of every branch), and limits
(per-account usage via cclimits) — plus a click-only control plane: chat with
any agent, resume a limit-stuck one when its session limit resets, dispatch
new tmux-hosted agents into free worktrees, and finish a done mission (an
agent lands the branch; the worktree goes free).

Watching is read-only and touches nothing. Acting (chat/resume/dispatch/
finish) happens only on an explicit request — dispatch spends account usage,
and finish hands a closeout brief to an agent that merges and pushes. When
the branch has already landed, finish skips the agent: it parks the worktree
back on the trunk itself (switch + pull — the one provably-safe case where
the board runs git write commands). Zero dependencies — python3 stdlib only.

Configuration precedence: CLI flags > orchestra.config.json (next to this
script, else cwd) > defaults. See README.md.
