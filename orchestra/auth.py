"""orchestra.auth — who is allowed to ask, and what it costs to be wrong.

Until this module existed the server had no authentication of any kind, and
`127.0.0.1` was the whole of its security. That is a real defence and it is
also a ceiling: the board cannot leave the machine. What sits behind the door
is not a dashboard — it is the full text of every prompt and every reply, plus
a keyboard attached to terminals running `--dangerously-skip-permissions`,
plus a dispatch button that spends real usage. So the threat model is not
"someone reads a status page"; it is `POST /api/send` typing an instruction
into an agent that will act on it.

ADR 0013 decided where the security budget goes: **not** TLS (WireGuard has
already encrypted the link, and the realistic attacker inside a tailnet is a
compromised or shared DEVICE, which TLS does nothing about) but tokens. This
module is those tokens.

THE RULE, stated once so it can be quoted and tested:

    LOOPBACK IS TRUSTED. EVERYTHING ELSE MUST PRESENT A VALID TOKEN.
    A CREDENTIAL THAT IS PRESENTED IS ALWAYS CHECKED, WHEREVER IT CAME FROM.
    AND A PAGE FROM ANOTHER SITE IS NOT LOOPBACK, WHATEVER THE SOCKET SAYS.

The first clause is what keeps the existing browser working — it has no token
and never will. It is not a compromise, it is an accurate statement of the
boundary: anything that can open a socket to 127.0.0.1 is already a process
running as you on this Mac, and such a process can read `~/.claude*/projects`
directly, with no server involved. A token would guard a door in a wall that
is not there (API.md §2.6 lists this as *unclosable*, and it is).

The third clause is the one that was nearly missed, and it is the reason the
first is safe to write down at all. A website you have open in a tab also
speaks from 127.0.0.1 — through your browser, with your loopback trust — and
`POST /api/send` types into an agent running `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
That is CSRF, it predates this module, and it is closed here by requiring
`Content-Type: application/json` on every mutation (which forces a CORS
preflight this server refuses) and by rejecting a cross-site `Origin`.

The second clause is what stops that trust from being a bypass. A request from
loopback carrying a *bad* token is refused rather than waved through as
"anonymous loopback", because the only ways to produce one are a stale app, a
revoked device, or something on this machine guessing — and none of the three
should be answered with 200. It also means the day a proxy is ever put in
front of this server (`tailscale serve` makes every request arrive from
loopback — API.md §2.7 blocks it for exactly this reason), a token that has
been revoked stays revoked instead of being laundered into anonymity.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE:

* **Scopes.** API.md §2.2 designs `read`/`act`/`admin` and this module
  implements none of it: one token grants everything. A phone that can read
  but cannot act is not the product, so the split buys nothing yet, and a
  half-built scope ladder is worse than an honest absence — it invites the
  belief that a `read` token is safe to hand out. Deferred, whole.
* **Pairing.** Tokens are minted on this machine (`python3 -m orchestra
  --add-device`) and carried to the phone by hand. The QR/pairing-code dance
  of API.md §3 needs a bootstrap route that is exempt by construction, which
  is a second unauthenticated door; it can wait until there is a phone to walk
  through it.
* **Origin allowlist, tailnet whois, lockdown** — steps 3, 7 and 8 of API.md
  §2.3's guard. Each is a real check and none of them is the *missing* one.
  The other two on that list have since landed and are no longer absences: the
  **Host allowlist** is step 2 and it is right here (`allowed_hosts` /
  `host_allowed`, `HOST_NOT_ALLOWED`), and **idempotency** is step 10 and lives
  in `idem.py`, which `server.do_POST` wraps every keyed mutation with.

Nothing in this module imports anything above `config`: it is a leaf, and it
has to be, because it runs before every route and must not be able to reach
the code it is guarding. `REGISTRY` and `AUDIT_LOG` are rebound at runtime by
tests, so — the `resume.RESUME_STATE` rule, ADR 0010 — they are deliberately
NOT re-exported by the facade. Reach them as `auth.REGISTRY`.

# with your loopback trust. That is CSRF, it has been live in this server since
# it was written, and `POST /api/send` under `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
# is the worst possible thing to leave behind it.
#
# What stops it is the CORS preflight, which fires for a cross-origin request
# only if the request is not "simple" — and `Content-Type: application/json` is
# exactly what makes it not simple. So: requiring the header turns every
# cross-origin mutation into an OPTIONS this server answers with a refusal and
# no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, at which point the browser never sends the
# POST at all. Without it, a plain form or a `text/plain` fetch reaches
# `do_POST`, which never looked at the media type and simply `json.loads`ed the
# body. The attacker cannot read the reply either way; they do not need to —
# typing the instruction IS the attack.
#

JSON_TYPE = "application/json"

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- exempt routes
#
# The complete list, and it is one entry long.
#
# `GET /api/health` is open because it is the route you need BEFORE you have a
# token: it is how a phone distinguishes "the Mac is asleep" from "my token was
# revoked" from "I typed the address wrong", and a health check that requires
# the credential you are trying to diagnose can only ever report a tautology.
# It is safe to open because it carries no fleet data at all — no worktrees, no
# counts, no hostname, no device list, nothing that varies with what you are
# doing. It answers "a server that speaks this protocol is alive here, and its
# clock says T". Everything an unauthenticated peer learns from it, it already
# learned by completing the TCP handshake, except the clock skew it needs to
# read a timestamp correctly.
#
# NOTHING ELSE IS EXEMPT, and the two candidates that were considered are worth
# writing down because both look harmless:
#
#   * the static pages (`/`, `/stream.js`, `/map`, `/limits`, `/guide`). They
#     contain no transcript text — they are the app shell, and its source is
#     public. But exempting them buys nothing: a browser cannot attach an
#     `Authorization` header to a top-level navigation, so a phone browser
#     would load the shell and then fail every fetch inside it, which is a
#     worse failure than being refused at the door. ADR 0002 puts a native
#     client on the phone; the board is a loopback program. So they stay shut,
#     and the tailnet sees exactly one open route.
#   * `GET /api/state`. It is "just a summary" until you read it: session
#     topics are the first line of what you typed, and the board's whole point
#     is knowing what each agent is doing. It reads transcript text. Shut.
#
# The match is EXACT on the path with its query stripped, while `server.Handler`
# routes by `startswith`. That asymmetry is deliberate and one-directional: a
# path this list does not recognise is refused even if the router would have
# served it, so `/api/healthcheck-for-free` is a 401 and not a hole.
EXEMPT = frozenset({("GET", "/api/health"), ("POST", "/api/v1/pair")})

# The second exempt route, added with pairing, and it is the one that deserves
# the most suspicion — an unauthenticated POST that hands out a credential.
# What guards it is not authentication (there is none to have; that is the
# point) but four things that are all in `pairing.claim`, in this order:
#
#   * the claimant must be on loopback or the tailnet, checked BEFORE the code;
#   * a window must be open, unclaimed and unexpired — 120 s, single use;
#   * attempts are budgeted per source IP, and spend from THIS module's failure
#     budget as well, which is what ADR 0014 promised when it deferred pairing;
#   * the code is compared with `compare_digest` over sha256.
#
# It is exempt from the TOKEN check only. Everything else in `check` still runs
# — the cross-site guards included, so a page you are visiting cannot post a
# pairing claim through your browser.

# Routes that answer to THIS MACHINE ONLY, and to nobody holding a token.
#
# API.md §2.5 puts device management behind an `admin` scope and says phones are
# never issued it. ADR 0014 deferred scopes whole, so `admin` cannot be a scope
# today — and inventing a half-scope for one route is exactly what that ADR
# refused to do. What it can be, and what is strictly stronger, is a rule with
# no ladder in it at all:
#
#     DEVICE MANAGEMENT IS THE ABSENCE OF A TOKEN, FROM THIS MACHINE.
#
# So no token grants it. A phone cannot list devices, cannot open a pairing
# window, and — the one that matters — cannot revoke a device, including the
# device that would have revoked IT. A stolen phone holding a valid token gets
# 403 on all three, which is the same answer it would get if scopes existed and
# it held `act`. When scopes do arrive this rule becomes `scope == admin` and
# nothing else about the surface changes.
#
# Matched by PREFIX, unlike `EXEMPT`, because `/api/v1/devices/<id>/revoke`
# carries an identity in the path. The asymmetry is one-directional in the safe
# direction: a path this list matches too eagerly is a refusal, never a hole.
ADMIN = ("/api/v1/devices",)

# The refusal code for that rule. Distinguishable from `unauthorized` on
# purpose: the holder of a good token learns that the token is fine and the
# ROUTE is not theirs, which is what stops an app retrying pairing forever.
ADMIN_ONLY = "admin_local_only"

# Requests that are written to the audit log when they are ALLOWED. Refusals
# are always logged, whatever the route.
#
# "A mutation" is every non-GET method, plus the one GET that acts: `/api/focus`
# raises a terminal window and steals the user's focus. Reads are deliberately
# not logged, and the reason is volume rather than principle — the board polls
# `/api/state`, so logging reads would write a line every few seconds forever
# and bury the eleven lines that matter in a year of noise. A stolen token that
# only ever reads leaves no evidence here; that is a known gap, and the honest
# way to close it is a counter in `meta`, not a log nobody can grep.
SIDE_EFFECT_GETS = ("/api/focus",)

# …and the one mutation that is NOT logged, which is the same argument running
# the other way.
#
# `POST /api/hook` is a Claude Code hook edge (ADR 0007). It fires several times
# per agent turn from every hooked session on the machine — the comment above
# says logging reads would "write a line every few seconds forever and bury the
# eleven lines that matter", and this route is an order of magnitude louder than
# `/api/state` polling ever was. A busy fleet would push a megabyte a day of
# `POST /api/hook allow` through `audit.log.jsonl` and make the log useless for
# the thing it exists for.
#
# It is safe to leave out because of what the route can DO, which is nothing: it
# writes one entry to an in-memory dict that expires in 90 s and never leaves
# the process. It types at no agent, reads no transcript and returns no fleet
# data. The honest replacement is exactly what that comment prescribes — a
# COUNTER rather than a log — and `observer.stats()` carries it as
# `hook_received` / `hook_live` / `hook_ignored`.
#
# REFUSALS ARE STILL LOGGED. `audited` only governs the allow path, so a peer
# that is refused here appears in the log like any other refusal — which is the
# half that could ever be evidence of anything.

#
#   * the audit log cannot be flooded by an unauthenticated peer — the ceiling
#     is 10 lines/min/IP, ~90 KB a day from one attacker, so evidence of a real
#     theft is still findable beside it;
#   * a sha256 per attempt cannot be turned into CPU load;
#   * and the one that will matter later: the pairing code of API.md §3 is six
#     digits, and it will inherit this bucket. 10/min is 2.9 % of a 10**6 space
#     over a weekend, which is why the pairing window is also 120 s.
#
# Per source IP, token bucket. Only FAILURES spend from it, so no legitimate
# client can be throttled by using the board hard, and a success empties it —
# whoever holds a valid token can already do everything a token permits, so

    `server.Handler.parse_request` is its only caller inside the package, which
    is what makes it unskippable: every route in the process is dispatched
    *after* `parse_request` returns True, so a route cannot opt out, forget, or
    be added without it. See `tests/test_auth.py::TestEveryRouteIsGuarded`,
    which reads the routes back out of the handler's own source rather than
    from a list that would rot.

    The order below is load-bearing; each step is where it is for a reason:

    1. **Exempt route** — before the budget, after the browser guards are in
       scope. `/api/health` must answer when the credential is the thing being
       diagnosed, and `POST /api/v1/pair` must answer a phone that has no token
       yet; neither validates a token, so there is nothing here to brute-force.
       Exempt means *no token required*, NOT *no checks*: the cross-site guards
       run on both, because one of them is a mutation.
    2. **Loopback with no credential** — before the budget is consulted. This
       is what makes the browser un-throttleable: a request that presents
       nothing from a machine that is already inside cannot fail, so it can
       never spend from a bucket, so no flood from anywhere else can lock the
       board out of its own server.
    3. **The budget** — before the token is looked at, so an exhausted peer
       costs a dict lookup rather than a sha256, and learns nothing from the
       timing of a refusal it was never going to pass.
    4. **Shape**, then **identity**, then **revocation**. Each refuses; each
       spends one from the budget.
    4a. **Admin** — after the token is known good, so the answer is "this route
       is not yours" rather than "who are you". No token reaches it; see
       `ADMIN`.
    5. **The browser guards** — `Origin`, and `Content-Type` on a mutation.
       LAST, on BOTH allow paths, which is `browser_guards`' own docstring:
       they are about the browser rather than the caller, so they must not
       pre-empt a 401, and they must still run before anything is permitted.

    Everything unrecognised lands on a refusal. There is no branch here that
    ends in "allow" by falling through.

    What it costs, since it now runs on every request (20,000 calls each,
    against a one-device registry):

        exempt /api/health                    0.5 us
        loopback, no header — the board       1.8 us
        tailnet, valid token — the phone     14.9 us   (stat + sha256 + memo)
        tailnet, refused                     99.6 us   (an audit line, on disk)

    `/api/state` answers in ~800 us, so the board pays 0.2 % and a phone 1.9 %.
    A stream pays it ONCE, at open: `/api/events` is dispatched after this
    returns and then holds the socket for its whole life, so a keepalive costs
    nothing here. The expensive row is the refusal, and it is expensive because
    it writes to disk — which is the one row an attacker controls, and the
    reason the failure budget exists.

    ADR 0013's first consequence: *"the server refuses to bind beyond loopback
    unless a token is configured. Silent wide exposure must be impossible."*
    Binding a tailnet address with an empty registry would serve every
    transcript on the machine to every device on the tailnet, and — this is the
    part that makes it a refusal rather than a warning — it would do it
    SILENTLY, because the failure looks exactly like success.

    `0.0.0.0` is refused unless the user asked for it by a DIFFERENT NAME.
    It is not a tailnet bind; it is every interface including the coffee-shop
    wifi, and ADR 0013 is explicitly scoped to the tailnet ("if the server is
    ever exposed … TLS stops being optional and this ADR must be superseded").
    Making that transition loud rather than silent is the ADR's own instruction.

    So `--host 0.0.0.0` remains a refusal — that spelling is one slip of muscle
    memory away from a tailnet address, and its error message now names the
    flag that does what the user probably meant (`--tailnet`). The escape hatch
    is `--bind-every-interface`, which cannot be typed by accident and cannot
    be set from the config file at all (`config.load_config` overwrites the key
    from the parsed arguments every time, so a stale line in a JSON file cannot
    quietly open the machine). It does NOT bypass the registry check below: a
