"""orchestra.server — the only door in: one handler, one check, no framework.

THE DOOR IS NOW LOCKED. `parse_request` runs `auth.check` before any `do_*`
method is dispatched, so authentication is not a thing each route remembers to
do — it is a thing no route can reach past. Loopback is trusted (the browser
has no token and never will); everything else presents `Authorization: Bearer
orc1_…`; `GET /api/health` is the single exempt route. The reasoning is in
`auth.py`, which is deliberately a leaf: it cannot import the code it guards.

`Handler` is the whole HTTP surface. GET is the watching half — the board's
state (with the resume schedules riding along so it needs no second fetch),
the map's topology, limits, the dispatch log, a chat drawer — plus the four
static HTML pages, read off disk from `config.HERE` on every request so an
edit shows up on reload. POST is the acting half, and every one of its routes
is a click somebody made: reserve, schedule/cancel a resume, send text to a
session, finish a mission, dispatch a new agent, take an image off the phone
and write it to this Mac (`uploads.py` — the reply is the path, and the path
is what an agent can actually read).

`GET /api/events` is the one route that is not a request/response at all: it
is the state STREAM (ADR 0005), a socket held open for the life of the client
that emits one frame per version bump off the observer's publish point. Every
other route answers and hangs up; this one answers and stays.

It is a thin router by design. Nothing here decides anything: each branch
parses the request, hands it to the module that owns the verb, and JSON-dumps
whatever comes back. Errors travel inside the payload (`{"ok": false, …}`)
rather than as HTTP status codes — the board renders the message either way,
and a 500 would tell it less. Only an unknown path is a real 404. The stream
is the exception there too: it has no payload to put an error inside before it
has started, so its two refusals (no sweep running, cap reached) are real 503s.

Top of the import graph: it imports every layer and nothing imports it back.
`log_message` is silenced so the terminal you launched the board from stays
readable.

        `{"ok": false, "error": …}` is this server's error convention (module
        docstring), so a refusal renders in the board's existing message path
        rather than as a blank tab. The status is real, though — unlike the
        in-payload errors, a 401 is something an HTTP client must be able to
        act on without parsing anything, and `WWW-Authenticate` is what makes
        it a legal one.

        THE BODY OF A REFUSED POST IS NOT READ, and that took three
        measurements to settle. Answering while the client is still writing can
        leave it blocked in `sendall`, raising BrokenPipe INSTEAD OF READING
        THE 401 — a revoked phone that cannot tell "revoked" from "the Mac is
        asleep" retries forever. A draft of this handler therefore drained the
        body first, and a probe against a hand-rolled server said the guard was
        needed from 512 KB up.

        It is not, and that probe was the wrong harness: it closed the socket
        outright, where `socketserver.shutdown_request` half-closes it
        (`SHUT_WR`) first — which lets the client's remaining bytes drain into
        the kernel instead of earning an RST that discards the response.
        Re-measured against THIS server, a refused POST whose body is never
        read:

            400 KB · 600 KB · 800 KB   401, every time
            1 MB                       401, mostly — flaky with the drain and
                                       without it
            2 MB and up                BrokenPipe / ConnectionReset

        The board's own POSTs are kilobytes — a chat message, a mission brief —
        so the whole band a drain could rescue is one no client reaches, and
        the price was reading a megabyte on behalf of somebody who has not
        authenticated. Removed; the test that "proved" it was flaky in exactly
        the band the measurement says is flaky. What is left is this note, so
        that the next person to probe it on a toy server finds the answer
        before writing the code.
