"""orchestra.tailnet — find the address to bind, instead of asking for it.

ADR 0001 puts the phone on a tailnet and ADR 0013 puts plain HTTP on it. Both
leave one operational question: **which address?** The answer on this machine is
`100.113.110.31`, and the way that used to reach the server was the user typing
it into `--host`. That is a bad interface for a security-relevant setting:

* it is a magic number nobody remembers, so it gets pasted from somewhere, and
  the somewhere is usually a document that is now out of date;
* it can be typed WRONG in a direction that is worse than not working — `0.0.0.0`
  is one keystroke from a tailnet address in muscle memory, and it is every
  interface including whatever wifi you are on;
* and Tailscale can reassign it.

So the address is DETECTED. `--tailnet` means "bind wherever Tailscale put me",
and if Tailscale is not running there is nothing to bind and the server says so
in those words rather than dying on `EADDRNOTAVAIL`.

## What "detected" means here, and why it is a bind and not a parse

Two sources, then one measurement:

1. **`ifconfig`** — every `inet` address on the box, filtered to the CGNAT range
   Tailscale allocates from (`100.64.0.0/10`, RFC 6598 — NOT RFC 1918, which is
   why `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` does not cover it either, ADR 0013).
2. **`tailscale ip -4`** — the daemon's own opinion. It answers even when the
   backend is `Stopped`, which is exactly the case that needs a good error
   message: the address is *known* and *not bindable*.

Then the candidate is **actually bound**, on port 0, and thrown away. That is
the whole check. METHOD.md §2 is about measuring the thing rather than a proxy
for it, and the thing here is "will `Server(...)` succeed" — not "does this
string look like a tailnet address", not "is there an interface", not "is the
daemon up". A source that lists an address whose interface is down passes every
proxy check and fails the real one, which is the failure this module exists to
turn into a sentence.

## What this module refuses to do

It does not turn anything on. If Tailscale is stopped, `address()` returns None
and the caller refuses to start — it does not run `tailscale up`, which would be
a program that changes your network configuration because you asked it to serve
a web page.

    for `ts.net` (with subdomains), which covers every tailnet's MagicDNS
    names — and it cannot ship one for each user's raw `100.64/10` literal,
    because an ATS exception is a plist key baked in at build time. So a QR

    is reported even on tailnets with MagicDNS switched off, and advertising
    a name the phone cannot resolve is strictly worse than the IP. The

    advertised into the QR the phone scans (`pairing.advertised`), so it is

    review L2). It matches the exact `ts.net` ATS exception the store build
