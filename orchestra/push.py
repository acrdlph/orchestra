"""orchestra.push — the APNs transport: an ES256 provider token, and one POST.

This module is TRANSPORT ONLY. It knows how to sign a JWT, how to put bytes on
the wire, and how to read Apple's answer. It has no opinion about when a
notification is worth sending, what it should say, or whether the user is
asleep — that is `notify.py`, and the seam between them is `Sink.send`, one
method taking an already-composed payload.

Zero dependencies is preserved by shelling out rather than by importing: the
stdlib has no ECDSA and no HTTP/2 client, and ADR 0003 traded two macOS
binaries for a pip install. Both go through `shell.run`, which is the seam the
test suite already stands in for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SHARP EDGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

`openssl dgst -sha256 -sign` emits an ASN.1 **DER** signature —
`SEQUENCE { INTEGER r, INTEGER s }`. JWS/ES256 requires **raw r‖s, 64 bytes**,
each half fixed at 32. They are not the same bytes and one is not a prefix of
the other. Get this wrong and Apple answers `403 InvalidProviderToken`, which
is the SAME answer you get for a wrong Key ID, a wrong Team ID, an expired
token and a `.p8` from another account — five causes, one message, no detail.

DER integers are signed and minimal-width, so the length varies per signature.
Measured on this machine, 400 signatures from one P-256 key:

    total DER length   69: 1     70: 93    71: 204   72: 102
    (len r, len s)     (32,31): 1  (32,32): 93  (32,33): 97
                       (33,32): 107  (33,33): 102

Three consequences, and each one is a bug somebody ships:

  * **A fixed-offset parser is wrong 77 % of the time here.** `der[4:36]` is
    correct only for the (32,32) case, which is under a quarter of them.
  * **A parser that assumes 32-byte integers is wrong 0.25 % of the time** —
    the (32,31) row. `s` came back SHORT because its leading byte was zero, and
    a 31-byte half concatenated raw produces a 63-byte signature that Apple
    rejects. It happened once in 400 and it is the case left-padding exists
    for. ARCHITECTURE.md's measured distribution (`{70: 96, 71: 194, 72: 110}`)
    does not contain this row at all — it never observed a short integer, so a
    reader would conclude `rjust` is defensive rather than load-bearing.
  * **A 33-byte integer is not an error.** It is a 32-byte value whose high bit
    is set, wearing DER's mandatory `0x00` sign pad. 52 % of signatures have at
    least one.

`der_to_raw` is therefore a real parser: it reads lengths, strips the sign pad,
left-pads to the curve width, and REFUSES anything it does not fully
understand. It is the most heavily tested function in this package, and
`tests/test_push.py` verifies its output the only way that proves anything —
by checking the resulting r‖s against the public key with an independent
P-256 implementation that shares no code with it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WAS MEASURED HERE, AND WHAT COULD NOT BE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Against Apple's real sandbox, from this machine, with no key:

    curl -sS --config … https://api.sandbox.push.apple.com/3/device/abc123
    → HTTP/2 403 · apns-id: 030E7BEF-… · {"reason":"InvalidProviderToken"}

So the transport works end to end: HTTP/2 negotiates, the request is accepted,
Apple answers with an `apns-id` and a reason. Everything below the provider
token is proven. The provider token itself cannot be proven without a `.p8`
that only the account holder can create — see `docs/mobile/APNS-SETUP.md`.

The token never rides argv. `ps` is world-readable on macOS, so a
`-H "authorization: bearer eyJ…"` would publish a 40-minute credential to
every process on the machine. It goes in a mode-0600 config file that curl
reads and we delete.

ONE REQUEST PER `curl`. Batching N pushes into one process with `--next`
separators looks obvious and is broken: `--next` resets all LOCAL options, and
`header` is local. Verified here against a local echo server —

    transfer 1 → authorization: bearer GLOBAL
    transfer 2 → None                          ← unauthenticated
    transfer 3 → authorization: bearer THIRD

so every push after the first would go out with no credential and come back
403. Repeating every option inside every block fixes it; not batching avoids
it. At fleet scale (a phone or three) the handshake is not the cost worth
optimising, and the failure mode of getting it wrong is silent.

                          rejected outright rather than delivered silently.
      `apns-priority`     10 delivers immediately; 5 lets iOS bundle it for
                          power. 10 on a `background` push is rejected.
      `apns-expiration`   an ABSOLUTE epoch, and this is the classic. Writing
                          `900` means "expired in 1970", so Apple makes ONE
                          attempt and never stores-and-forwards — silently, and
