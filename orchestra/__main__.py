"""python3 -m orchestra — start the board.

The old `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, moved verbatim out of the module
that is now the package facade (where it would have been dead code, since
`__name__` there is 'orchestra'). It reaches the app through module objects,
never through imported names: config.DEMO is rebound here at startup, and a
`from .config import DEMO` would freeze a copy and silently disable demo mode.

It is also the device admin CLI (`--add-device`, `--list-devices`,
`--revoke-device`). Those live at a shell on this machine rather than behind a
route on purpose: a device that can revoke devices can revoke the device that
would have revoked IT, so the admin surface is the one thing that must not be
reachable from the tailnet (API.md §2.5 puts every device route behind
`admin`, and phones are never issued `admin`).

    This is not a convenience; without it a `--tailnet` board is broken in two
    ways that only show up once you actually run one, and both were found by
    doing exactly that:

    1. **The board's own bookmark stops working.** A server bound to
       `100.113.110.31` is not listening on `127.0.0.1` at all, so
       `http://localhost:4242` — which is where the four pages live and what
       every link in them is relative to — is `ConnectionRefused`.

    2. **Device management becomes unreachable from the Mac itself.** A request
       the Mac sends to its own tailnet address arrives with a source address
       of `100.113.110.31`, which is not loopback and never can be. Since
       `auth.ADMIN` answers only to this machine holding no token, a
       tailnet-only bind means NOBODY can open a pairing window or revoke a
       device — including the person sitting at the keyboard. The security
       rule was right and the topology made it unusable.

    So the tailnet listener carries the phone and the loopback listener carries
    the board, which is the split API.md §2.3 assumed all along when it wrote
    about "the tailnet listeners" and "the loopback listener" separately.

    Not added for `0.0.0.0`: that already includes `127.0.0.1`, and a second
    bind would fail with EADDRINUSE — the wide bind is a different shape of
    mistake and it does not need this one on top.
