"""orchestra.gitrepo — the git layer: which worktrees exist, and where
every branch really is.

Two jobs that both start with a directory listing. `discover_worktrees` walks
the configured roots and returns the dirs that are git checkouts (a bare
`<worktree>/.git` or the `<worktree>/repo/.git` layout); `git_info` asks git
for one worktree's branch, tip, dirt and ahead/behind. `branch_topology` is
the expensive one behind the map view — fork point, tip and drift for every
branch, grouped by origin URL — so it sits behind a 30 s cache.

`munge` and `match_worktree` are here rather than with the transcript code
because both are pure functions on a *path*: Claude Code names a project dir
after the cwd it was started in, and mapping that name back to a worktree is
git-side knowledge. The longest-prefix rule in `match_worktree` is the reason
'myapp' never swallows 'myapp-audit'.

Everything reads; nothing here writes to a repo. The only git write commands
the board ever runs live in the finish path — and every `git status` here
carries `--no-optional-locks`, because the plain form rewrites `.git/index`,
which is a write however read-only the intent (see `git_info`).

    Two `git` spawns, not five: `status --porcelain=v2 --branch` carries the
    branch, the upstream, ahead/behind and the dirty list in a single pass,
    replacing `branch --show-current`, `status --porcelain` and
    `rev-list --left-right --count`. `log -1` stays separate — v2 reports the
    commit oid but not its timestamp or subject.

    `--no-optional-locks` is not a micro-optimisation, it is the difference
    between reading a repo and writing one. Plain `git status` rewrites
    `.git/index` with the refreshed stat cache — measured here, the inode
    changes on every call — which means taking `index.lock`. Lazily that was a
    write per worktree per look; under the perpetual sweep it is a write per
    worktree every few seconds, forever, and the agent living in that worktree
    is the one whose `git commit` fails with "Unable to create index.lock" when
    the two collide. The flag also costs nothing: measured 16.5 ms against
    17.6 ms for the plain form, because not writing is faster than writing.

    Three things about that format bite silently, all reproduced before this
    was written:

    * A detached HEAD reports the bare string `(detached)` with no sha. The
      label CANNOT be rebuilt by slicing `branch.oid`, because git's abbrev
      length is per-repository — measured 8 characters in one worktree of this
      fleet and 9 in the other eight. So detached heads spend one extra spawn
      on `rev-parse --short`, which is both exact and rare.
    * `# branch.ab` is ABSENT when there is no upstream — not `+0 -0`. Left
      unset, ahead/behind stay None, which is what the caller expects.
    * `# branch.ab +A -B` is ahead-then-behind, the OPPOSITE order to
      `rev-list --left-right --count @{u}...HEAD`, which puts the upstream
      first. Reading them positionally inverts every count on the board.
