"""orchestra.dispatch — launching new agents, and typing at the ones we launch.

Dispatch is the act layer's other half: ✓ finish ends a mission, dispatch
starts one. It picks deterministically — the cleanest FREE worktree, the
account with the most headroom that can actually run the chosen model — and
refuses to choose the model or the effort for you. When no account clears its
reserve for that model, it comes back with a needs_decision instead of quietly
spending someone else's usage.

The launch itself is tmux on its own socket (`FLEET_SOCK`), so the fleet never
collides with the user's own tmux server. Getting the brief INTO the CLI is
the fiddly part: the composer's paste heuristic chops a rapid send-keys burst
into '[Pasted text #N]' chips that swallow the Enter, so `deliver_text` pastes
atomically via a tmux buffer and then presses Enter until `kickoff_sent`
proves the composer let go of it.

Every launch appends a line to `DISPATCH_LOG` — the audit trail, with the
author's original words next to the brief the agent actually got. Jobs run on
background threads; `_jobs` holds their progress so the browser can poll
`dispatch_status` without holding an HTTP request open.

`closeout_shell` lives here rather than in `finish`, where its prose belongs:
it is the tmux command a DISPATCH runs, `_run_dispatch` is its only caller,
and keeping it here is what breaks the finish↔dispatch import cycle (ADR 0010,
'cycles'). It takes the brief as a parameter and touches no CLOSEOUT_* text,
so it carries nothing with it.

DISPATCH_LOG is rebound at runtime (tests point it at a temp file), so it is
deliberately NOT re-exported by the facade — reach it as `dispatch.DISPATCH_LOG`.
