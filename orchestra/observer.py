"""orchestra.observer — one board-shaped snapshot of everything being watched.

`collect_state` is the join: worktrees from `gitrepo`, live processes from
`procs`, sessions from `transcripts`, then policy on top. First the limit
join — an agent parked at the prompt on an exhausted account isn't "your
turn", it's out of juice — read from the cclimits cache, or from the CLI's own
limit notice in the transcript when that cache is cold. Then handoff
awareness: a stranded session whose worktree has a FRESHER live one is
annotated `handed_to` and stops counting as attention. Then each card gets an
availability, the cards get a severity sort, and the counts strip is tallied.

Watching is read-only and touches nothing: every read here is a `git`/`ps`
query or a bounded tail of a transcript. Nothing is written, nothing is typed,
and no state another module owns is reaped — under a perpetual sweep any such
write becomes a scheduled background action nobody asked for.

`_cache` holds the last snapshot for `STATE_TTL_S` seconds when nothing is
sweeping, and for as long as a running sweep promises to refresh it
(`Observer.republish_s`) when something is, so a board polling every couple of
seconds doesn't re-shell `git` twice a second. It is mutated
in place and never rebound: the act layer parks a `_cache["t"] = 0.0` in it so
a button reverts on the very next poll instead of four seconds later, and the
tests poke `_cache["state"]` through the facade — same object either way.
Patch `observer.cached_state`, never the facade copy.

`demo_state` is fictional data with the exact shape of `collect_state`, for
screenshots. `cached_state` is the one entry point the server calls.

`Observer` is the publish point (ENGINE.md §2.5): one perpetual thread that
sweeps on its own cadence and publishes an immutable, versioned `Snapshot`.
`GitCadence` is what makes that thread affordable: git is 79 % of a sweep's
CPU and cannot be stat-memoised (`dirty` is the working tree), so it runs on
its own slower clock and the sweep reuses the last answer — honestly, because
`freshness["git"]` publishes how old it is, and a `nudge()` pulls it forward.
The transcript scan is the opposite case and gets the opposite treatment: it
CAN be stat-memoised, so it is (`transcripts.StatMemo`), and so are the two
per-pid lookups behind the process probe, keyed on the process's generation
(`procs.ProcMemo`). The sweep's `cold` flag is what bypasses every one of those
once a minute to check they were telling the truth.
It exists because observation today happens only when a client asks — with no
browser attached nothing computes, nothing is detected, and no notification
can ever fire. That is structural, not a tuning problem.

Nothing starts it on import. `python3 -m orchestra` starts it; a test that
imports the package gets exactly today's lazy behaviour, and so does a
deployment that simply never calls `start_observer()` — that is the rollback.

def collect_state(fresh=None, git=None, cold=False, settle=None, hooks=None):
    """Compose the board. `fresh` is an optional out-parameter.

    Pass a dict and the collector stamps it `kind -> wall clock of that kind's
    last SUCCESSFUL probe` (ENGINE.md §3.3): one `generated_at` cannot say that
    git is 47s stale because a fetch wedged. Left None it costs nothing and this
    function behaves exactly as it did before there was an Observer — which is
    what keeps `python3 tests/characterize.py` byte-identical across this change.

    `git` is the other seam, and the same shape of promise: left None the git
    fan-out runs in full on this thread, exactly as it always has. The sweep
    passes `GitCadence.resolve` instead — `roots -> ({root: info}, probed_at)`
    — so git runs on its own slower clock and the sweep reuses the last answer
    in between. `probed_at` is what lands in `fresh["git"]`, so the freshness
    map reports when git ACTUALLY ran rather than when this function did.

    `cold` is the reconcile sweep (§4.3 #1): it bypasses every memo — the
    transcript stat memo, and the per-generation cwd/environment memos in
    `procs` — so every transcript is re-read from the file and every pid is
    re-probed, and each disagreement with what a memo would have served is
    counted into `drift`. It costs a full uncached collect once a minute and it
    is what makes the memos honest.

    `settle` is the third seam of the same shape, and the only one that carries
    memory: `sessions, now -> None`, damping a status that is on its way DOWN
    (ENGINE.md §6.3(a)). Left None this function is stateless per call, exactly
    as it has always been — which is what keeps `tests/characterize.py`
    reproducible and lets every test that calls `collect_state()` bare see the
    world as it is this instant. The `Observer` passes its own `Settler`, so
    the hysteresis belongs to the thing that publishes rather than to a module
    global two callers share.

    `hooks` is the fourth seam and the same promise a fourth time: `None` and
    this function knows nothing about Claude Code hooks and composes exactly the
    board it composed before ADR 0007. The `Observer` passes
    `HookEdges.live()` — `sid -> status`, ONE snapshot for the whole sweep, so
    every card in a frame is reconciled against the same instant and the
    hook store's lock is taken once rather than once per session.

    ORDER, and it is load-bearing three times over: the hook lands inside
    `scan_sessions` (it is an input to the status ladder, not a decoration on
    its output), so it is already applied when the limit join runs — a hooked
    ◆ YOUR TURN on an exhausted account still becomes ⛔ LIMIT HIT — and when
    `settle` runs, so a hook EXPIRING is damped by the anti-flicker dwell like
    any other de-escalation. A hook that could skip `settle` would be a source
    that can make the board blink, which is the one thing §6.3 forbids.

#                               IDLE_S 1.0 (the document's value) = 159 %
#
# So §2.5's prescribed 1.0 was not merely aggressive, it was unreachable: more
# than a full core, forever, with nobody watching. GIT_S is what makes it
# reachable. Git is 79 % of that CPU and the least volatile thing on the card,
# so it moves to its own slower clock and the sweep reuses the last answer in
# between. After: 0.31 CPU-s on a sweep that skips git, 1.65 on one that does
# not. Measured over 60 s of the real loop, not arithmetic:
#
#   IDLE_S  GIT_S   measured                     git_probes in 60 s
#     3.0     off     52 % of one core                 20        <- before
#     3.0     15      19 %                              4        <- shipped

#     1.0     15      43 %                              4
#
# 2.7x off the shipped cadence, and the document's 1.0 goes from impossible to
# merely expensive. IDLE_S stays 3.0: what it buys is notification latency, and
# 3 s is already far below the threshold for "did the board notice". Tightening
# it is now an argument somebody can win, which it was not before — but it is
# their argument, with their own measurement, not a free rider on this one.
#
# THEN the transcript scan stopped re-parsing files that had not changed
# (transcripts.py, the stat memo). Same fleet, same instrument, and this time
# the A/B is the memo turned off in the same process rather than a different
# build, so the git fan-out — which still dominates and whose probe count
# wobbles by one between runs — is held equal:
#
#   IDLE_S  memo    measured over 120 s      sweeps  git_probes
#     3.0    off      22 % of one core         41        9
#     3.0    on       18 %                     41        9        <- shipped

#     2.0    on       23 %                     31        5
#
# A sweep that skips git went 0.31 -> 0.19 CPU-s (six consecutive: 185/189/181/
# 197/219/205 ms), because scan_sessions went 196 -> 76 CPU-ms at a 98 %/96 %
# hit rate. The board-wide number moves less than that ratio suggests, and the
# table says why: 9 git fan-outs are ~15 of those 21.75 CPU-s. Git is still the
# bill. What is left of a git-free sweep is now ps+lsof (0.11) ahead of the
# scan (0.076), so the process probe is the next step, not this one.
#
# THEN the process probe stopped asking the kernel things that cannot change
# (procs.py, the per-generation memo). Same instrument, same in-process A/B:
#
#   IDLE_S  memo    measured over 120 s      sweeps  git_probes
#     3.0    off      16 % of one core         40        8
#     3.0    on       15 %                     40        8        <- shipped
#     1.0    off      30 %                    120        8
#     1.0    on       26 %                    120        8
#
# A git-free sweep went 0.19 -> 0.153 CPU-s (six consecutive: 153/156/152/151/
# 155/152 ms against 189/196/224/207/203/205), because `claude_processes` went
# 112 -> 73 CPU-ms: lsof and `ps eww` stop running at all on a fleet whose pids
# have not changed. What remains is one `ps` over the whole table, 68 of those
# 73 ms, and procs.py explains at length why it cannot be narrowed without
# breaking discovery.
#
# That is the smallest win of the three and the table says so plainly: 1 point
# at IDLE_S 3.0, 4 at 1.0. Git is still ~15 of the 18 CPU-s. The remaining
# sweep is now ONE `ps` (0.068) and the transcript scan (0.076) and nothing
# else worth naming — there is no fourth cheap win here, and the next honest
# argument is about GIT_S or about IDLE_S, with its own measurement.
#
# All five cadences below are DEFAULTS for config keys of the same name, not
# constants (`config.CFG["idle_s"]` &c). This one is the reason: the tables
# above are a trade whose right answer depends on whose laptop it is and
# whether it is plugged in, and it was a number you had to edit code to change.
#
# The knob table shipped for README.md, on the finished build — same fleet,
# same instrument, 120 s per row, one knob moved and the rest at their
# defaults. It is not the A/B tables above and does not supersede them: those
# isolate what each optimisation bought, this prices the settings a user can
# actually turn.
#
#   knob            value    CPU    sweeps  git_probes
#   idle_s           5.0     16 %      24        8
#   idle_s           3.0     17 %      40        8      <- default
#   idle_s           2.0     19 %      60        8
#   idle_s           1.0     28 %     119        8

#   reconcile_s      off     16 %      40        8
#
# Two things in there are worth more than the numbers themselves.
#
# FIRST: `idle_s` is not the expensive knob, `git_s` is. Tripling the sweep
# rate (3.0 -> 1.0) costs 11 points; tripling the GIT rate (15 -> 5) costs 12
# on its own, at an unchanged sweep rate. That is the memos' doing — a sweep
# that skips git is now ~0.15 CPU-s — and it is why 5.0 and 3.0 are one point
# apart. Anyone arguing about `idle_s` is arguing about the cheaper half.
#
# SECOND: the numbers this replaces were WRONG, and wrong in the direction that
# flatters an argument. The brief for this change quoted "1.0 costs 43 % and
# 3.0 costs 15 %" — 43 % is the row measured BEFORE the transcript memo and the
# process memo landed (it is in the first table above, where it was correct).
# Carried forward unmeasured, it overstates today's cost of `idle_s` 1.0 by
# 15 points and would have told a user that the aggressive setting is
# unaffordable when it is merely dearer. Re-measured because ADR 0011 says a
# performance claim without a measurement is not a claim — including, and
# especially, a claim inherited from this file's own earlier tables.
#
# THEN THE SWEEP STOPPED BEING THE MECHANISM. `watcher.py` holds a bounded set
# of kqueue fds over the project dirs and the in-window transcripts and calls
# `nudge()` when one of them moves, so the timer is a SAFETY NET rather than
# how anything is noticed (ADR 0012). That changes what `idle_s` buys. It no
# longer sets notification latency — measured, ten writes to a real transcript
# on the real fleet, median write -> nudge 53 ms and write -> published version
# 212 ms (max 468). It sets the worst case for the three things kqueue CANNOT
# see: a process being BORN (there is a filter for process death, none for
# birth), an append to a transcript already outside the 48 h window, and a
# subagent file more than one directory deep.
#
# NOTHING HAPPENING ANYWHERE. Same instrument, same fleet, 120 s per row, and
# A/B INTERLEAVED three times — this machine's load average wanders between 8
# and 50 and a straight sequence of rows measures the load, not the loop:
#
#   watch  idle_s   CPU of one core   sweeps  git_probes
#   off      3.0     13.3 / 13.9 / 15.2 %      40     8    <- the old default
#   on      30.0      5.8 /  5.3 /  5.8 %       4     4    <- shipped
#   on      60.0      3.1 %                     2     2
#
# 14 % -> 6 %, and the three timer-only rows are worth reading as a group: 13.3
# was taken at load 47, where the loop could only manage 13 sweeps instead of
# 40. That row FLATTERS the thing being replaced — under load the old cadence
# cannot even reach itself. 15.2 % at load 17, with the full 40 sweeps, is the
# honest one, and it matches the 17 % this file measured before the watcher.
#
# WITH ONE AGENT ACTUALLY WORKING, which is the regime that picks the number,
# because idle it barely matters:
#
#   idle_s   CPU    sweeps   of which event-driven
#     30.0    7.3 %     8            6              <- shipped
#     15.0    9.6 %    15           11
#      5.0   15.0 %    35           17
#
# Read the last column downward. Going 30 -> 5 buys 27 extra sweeps and 8
# points, and every one of those sweeps found something the events had already
# reported. That is the whole argument for 30.0 over anything tighter: below it
# the timer is re-discovering what it was just told. Above it, 60.0 saves 3
# points for twice the blind spot on the un-watchable three, and a `claude`
# started in a quiet worktree being invisible for a minute is the wrong side of
# "did the board notice me".
#
# `hot_s` is NOT the floor the watcher uses. It exists so a burst of MUTATIONS
# cannot spin the loop and is sized for a handful of them; a transcript being
# appended to continuously would nudge every 0.15 s forever, which at ~0.15
# CPU-s per git-free sweep is ~100 % of one core — worse than the timer it
# replaced. Event-driven nudges get their own rate limit, `watch_min_interval_s`
# (1.0 s), and the reasoning lives in watcher.py beside it.
IDLE_S = 30.0       # cadence with no evidence of change; config key "idle_s"

# What `idle_s` was before events, and what it goes back to the moment there
# are none: Linux (no stdlib inotify binding), a kqueue that failed to start, a
# watch thread that died. Read from the watcher's `running` on every wait, not
# latched at startup, so a watcher that dies at hour nine costs three seconds of
# latency rather than thirty. Degradation is automatic and logged once.
#
# A CEILING, not a substitute — `min(idle_s, idle_blind_s)`. Replacing `idle_s`
# outright would mean `Observer(idle_s=0.01)` silently ran at 3.0, i.e. an
# explicit argument losing to a default, which is the one rule every other
# cadence in this file keeps (`_cadence`, and the test named for it). Blind, the

# git's own clock, §2.5's `git_s`. The document says 5.0 and calls it a
# "re-probe cadence WITHIN a sweep", implying a memo; there cannot be one.
# branch/commit/ahead-behind could be keyed on `.git/HEAD` and the refs, but
# `dirty` depends on the WORKING TREE — any file the user or an agent saves —
# and no cheap stat detects that. (`.git/index` mtime does not: it moves when
# git writes the index, and `--no-optional-locks` exists precisely to stop git
# rewriting it when we look.) So this is a CADENCE, not a skip-if-unchanged
# memo: git is re-probed on a slower clock and the last answer is reused in
# between, which is honest only because `freshness["git"]` publishes its age.
#
# 15.0, not 5.0. At 5.0, git runs on ~2 sweeps in 3 and the loop still costs
# ~40 % of a core; at 15.0 it is 19 %. What the extra 10 s delays is a branch
# name, an ahead/behind count and a dirty count — none of which is why anybody
# watches this board, and all of which are dated on the card by
# `freshness["git"]`. Every event that MAKES git move (finish parking a
# worktree on the trunk, a dispatch cutting a branch) already calls `nudge()`,
# and a nudge pulls git forward, so the 15 s is only ever paid for edits nobody
# told us about. Worst case on the board is git_s + idle_s + the fan-out
# itself, ~18 s at the defaults.

# A cold sweep bypasses every memo and cadence (§4.3 #1) and counts what they
# would have got wrong as `drift`. Several terms now, and they mean opposite
# things, which is why `stats()` breaks them all out rather than shipping only
# the sum:
#
# * `git_drift` is not a lie. The cadence never claimed to be current and
#   `freshness["git"]` says how old it is; a disagreement is the measured COST
#   of running git on a slower clock, counted because a number nobody can see
#   is a number nobody can argue with. Non-zero is normal.
# * `scan_drift` / `tree_drift` ARE lies. The transcript stat memo claims the
#   bytes have not changed. Non-zero means the key is wrong — the one failure
#   mode that is otherwise completely silent, since a stale parse looks exactly
#   like a quiet agent. Non-zero is a bug.
# * `cwd_drift` / `env_drift` are lies too, and the worst kind: the
#   per-generation memo claims a pid is the same process it was, and a wrong
#   answer there is not a display bug — it is the act layer typing into the
#   wrong agent (ADR 0008). Non-zero is a bug.
#
# The cold scan costs 260 CPU-ms against a warm 76 on this fleet, and the cold
# process probe 116 against a warm 73, once a minute: well under 1 % duty for
# the only thing that can catch a memo lying.

# anything. It was 8.0 against an `idle_s` of 3.0, where it never bound. Raising
# `idle_s` to 30.0 for the watcher would have left it as the real cadence — the
# whole idle-CPU win, quietly cancelled by a constant three screens away, with

      `dirty 0` is worse than one whose dirty count is 12 s old. A root that

    no hysteresis — the same rollback story as versions, deltas and SSE, and

    make a session that returns 48 h later inherit a status from another day,

    `apply` mutates the sessions in place under a lock: the sweep thread and a

        publish (the sweep and a request-path `cached_state` that fell past

        a single BACKWARDS wall step (NTP correction, a VM/clone restore, a

        below `prev.at`, the regress guard returned `prev` for the whole delta,

        while the loop ran on. `time.monotonic()` cannot step backwards (and on
        macOS includes sleep — ENGINE §4.5), so it orders honestly. `at` stays
        wall: it is the wire clock a client derives age from and must not move.
        Left `None` — a direct `publish()` in a test, or a legacy caller — the

        not opt in changes.

        composed cards, never a fact-key -> card-key dependency map — a map is a
        second source of truth that drifts from the composition the first time
        somebody edits the pairing heuristic.

        THE COMPOSED VIEW IS EXACTLY FOUR TERMS: the stopwatch-stripped cards,
        `counts`, `other_procs`, and `nodes` (ADR 0016 — a node can appear
        with zero cards, which must move the version with no card changing).
        Adding a fifth is not a local change — every term here MUST ride every
        frame `delta_since` builds, or a client is told the version moved and
        given no way to learn what moved. Read `delta_since`'s audit before
        adding one; two tests fail if you do not.

        Cards are keyed `<node>/<worktree>` — `node.card_key`, which RAISES on
        a card without a `node` field: a card the merge never stamped, keyed
        quietly by bare name, is exactly the cross-machine collision ADR 0016

        An unknown, too-old or ahead-of-us `n` gets a full snapshot; that is the
        entire resync path. The envelope carries `type` from day one, so if
        deltas prove worthless deleting them removes lines and no concept.

        THE CONTRACT IS RECONSTRUCTION, not "the fields that moved". A client
        holding version `n` and applying this must end up with the SAME view as
        a client that took the snapshot at `v` whole — same cards, same order,
        same counts, same loose processes. ONE RULE, not two: `cards` is
        diffed, because cards are ~99 % of the bytes; EVERYTHING ELSE rides
        whole on every frame, precisely so that reconstruction is exact.

        THE AUDIT, because one of these was missing and the class matters more
        than the instance. `publish` bumps `v` on exactly three terms — the
        composed cards, `counts`, `other_procs` — and all three ride here. A
        term that can move the version and cannot ride a frame is the bug: the
        client is told "something changed" and given no way to learn what, and
        it stays wrong until its cursor falls out of the 512-version ring.
        Pinned from BOTH ends, because either half alone rots: every bump term
        reaches a delta consumer (`test_every_bump_term_reaches_a_delta_-
        consumer`), and nothing outside those three may bump at all
        (`test_nothing_outside_the_composed_view_can_bump_the_version`, which
        fails the day somebody adds a fourth term without adding it here).
        A third test pins the two branches to the same field set modulo `base`.

          field        rides   why
          cards        diff    the only diffed field, ~99 % of the bytes

          nodes        whole   a bump term (ADR 0016): a node appearing with
                               zero cards moves the version with no card
                               changing, and a client must be able to name
                               every node its cards reference (NODES.md §6)

                               no-bump path), so it can never cause this bug;
                               it rides because it is 2 B and dates the frame
          at, v, base  whole   the clock and the cursor

                               neither can produce this bug class, and both
                               are served whole by /api/stats

          free_worktr  NO      deliberate: a pure function of the cards, which
                               this contract already guarantees are exact. On
                               the wire it would be a second copy that can
                               disagree with the first — every applier derives
                               it (stream.js `state()`)
          resumes      NO      deliberate: it lives in resume.py, which the
                               observer does not watch at all, so arming one
                               moves no version and it could not ride this
                               stream however the frame were shaped

        The two that used to be missing, and both were silent divergence rather
        than a visible break:

        * **`order`.** `Snapshot.cards` is in the board's triage order and the
          board renders it in the order it arrives. A delta names only the
          changed keys, so a client patching its own dict keeps its OLD
          positions — a card that flips to `needs_input` would sort to the top
          on the server and stay where it was on a streaming board, forever.
          It is also what makes the wire independent of JSON object key order:
          `JSON.parse` in a browser reorders integer-like keys ahead of the
          rest, so a worktree named `42` sorts itself to the front of any
          client that trusted the dict.
        * **`other_procs`.** It is part of the composed view `publish` diffs, so
          a claude process appearing outside every watched worktree bumps the
          version ON ITS OWN — an otherwise EMPTY delta. Without the list on the
          frame that bump says "something changed" and carries no way to learn
          what, and the board's "⌁ live agents" tile drifts. Harmless while the
          browser also polls; it is the whole input the moment a phone is the
          client.

        WHOLE ON EVERY FRAME, rather than tracked in the changed-keys ring like
        a card — measured on the live 9-worktree / 9-loose-process fleet, not
        guessed, because the ratio it is weighed against is real (a 41,384 B
        snapshot frame against a 7,787 B one-card delta):

            other_procs, serialised                     1,172 B  (9 procs)
            one-card delta with it / without          7,787 B / 6,597 B
            i.e. 15 % of a median delta, 2.9 % of a full snapshot

            150 s of the real loop: 54 sweeps, 22 version bumps
              21 bumps moved cards only, 1 moved cards AND other_procs,
              0 moved other_procs alone, 0 moved counts alone
            so carrying it costs 22 x 1,189 B = 26 KB / 150 s = 172 B/s per
            subscriber, 5.5 KB/s at the 32-subscriber cap. Ring-tracking it
            would save 21 of those 22 — 166 B/s — over a tunnel WireGuard has
            already encrypted, to a phone for which the frame ARRIVING is the
            expensive event and its size is not.

        And it would cost the one thing this envelope is built out of. The ring
        holds CARD NAMES and this function reads them as `snap.cards.get(k)`, so
        a non-card entry in it is an instruction to DELETE a card; tracking
        `other_procs` there needs a second changed-set — a second source of
        truth about what moved, which is exactly what `publish`'s "diff by
        equality, never a fact-key -> card-key map" rule exists to prevent, and
        exactly the shape of the bug being fixed here: a version rule and a wire
        format that knew different things. Two rules where there is now one, for
        15 % of a frame.

        When per-entity change tracking IS worth paying for it is worth paying
        for generally, not for one field: /api/v1 §7.1 already gives `other` an
        address in the op space beside `counts`, `free` and `order`, and that is
        where it lands — as the format's rule, not as an exception inside this
        one. (A free consequence of carrying it whole, meanwhile: the loose
        processes' `cpu`/`etime` are refreshed on EVERY frame, where a card's
        stopwatches are only as fresh as the last time that card moved.)

        Never blocks, never fails, never a source of truth — a dropped nudge

        Sooner AND fuller, for a MUTATION: the nudge also pulls git off its
        cadence. Every such caller is a completed mutation (finish/exit parks a
        worktree back on the trunk, finish/brief and finish/nudge type at an
        agent that is about to commit, a dispatch cuts a branch), and a board

        mutations rather than per-reason: guessing which of them move the working
        tree is a second source of truth that goes stale the first time somebody
        adds a route.

        `git=False` is the WATCHER's nudge, and the distinction is not cosmetic.

    the very next request rather than making the user wait out a sweep. It
    passes no `git=`, so that collect probes git in full — the cadence is a
    background economy, and the one moment a user has just acted is not where
    to spend it. The nudge that accompanies every such mutation re-arms the
