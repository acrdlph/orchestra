"""orchestra.limits — how much usage each account has left, and who may spend it.

Everything here hangs off one external tool: `cclimits --json`
(github.com/acrdlph/cclimits), which reads Claude Code's own usage files per
account. Shelling out is expensive and the numbers move slowly, so
`cached_limits` sits behind a 5-minute cache and only refetches from the
network when a caller explicitly asks (`refresh=True`).

The rest is policy on top of that one payload. `account_reserve` is the
buffer an account must keep free before auto-dispatch will spend it;
`_model_remaining` folds the account-wide caps (session, weekly) together
with the one model-scoped cap that the model in hand would consume;
`model_candidates` ranks the accounts that could run a mission;
`limits_by_account` is the board's per-account summary, and it is careful to
keep a maxed model-scoped cap OUT of the account-wide `exhausted` flag —
an account whose Fable is gone still has headroom for an Opus mission.
`_limit_active_until` is the resume path's question: when does the cap that
stranded this session actually reset?

`_limits` is a mutable cache dict, mutated in place and never rebound, so the
facade re-export and the tests that poke `_limits["data"]` see the same
object. Patch `limits.cached_limits`, never the facade copy.

Every reset time in here is ABSOLUTE. cclimits answers in `resets_in_seconds`,
a countdown frozen the instant it was measured; `_absolutise_resets` converts
it once, at the fetch boundary, and nothing downstream ever sees the countdown
again (ENGINE.md §3.4). This matters because of the cache above it: the same
answer is served for up to LIMITS_TTL_S = 300 s, so a countdown read from it
can be five minutes wrong with nothing on the payload to say so.
