/* stream.js — ONE EventSource for the whole browser, held in a SharedWorker.
 *
 * THE CEILING IS THE BROWSER, NOT THE SERVER (ENGINE.md §5.4). The server was
 * measured to 32 concurrent streams at 1.4 ms p50 and survives far more; a
 * browser allows six connections per origin, full stop. One EventSource per TAB
 * would spend the whole budget at six tabs and starve every POST before that —
 * so the stream lives HERE, in a SharedWorker, and the tabs read its output.
 *
 * Three jobs, and nothing else:
 *
 *   1. hold the stream and apply its frames (`Fleet`), so the board is TOLD
 *      about a change ~1 s after the observer sees it instead of finding out on
 *      its next five-second poll;
 *   2. fetch the two things no frame carries — see `refresh()`;
 *   3. fan the composed state out to every tab: unicast on the port when a tab
 *      joins, BroadcastChannel for updates.
 *
 * DEGRADE, NEVER ASSUME. A board that silently stopped updating because a
 * socket died would be far worse than one that polls, so polling is not a
 * legacy path here — it is what runs whenever the stream is not PROVEN live,
 * and the proof is a frame arriving, not a socket opening. The two refusals the
 * server can give (`--demo`, which runs no sweep, and the subscriber cap) both
 * arrive as a 503, which EventSource reports without retrying; that is the case
 * `streamDead` names, and it is retried on a slow clock in case the server
 * gains an observer or a slot.
 *
 * Loaded by node as a module (`tests/test_stream_js.py`) it exports `Fleet` and
 * stops before the worker half — the applier the tests check is the applier
 * that ships.
