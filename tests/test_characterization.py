"""The characterization snapshot, as a test, so CI enforces it.

See tests/characterize.py for why this exists: the unit suite monkeypatches module globals at
67 sites, and a module split silently disarms those patch points. This check patches nothing,
so it stays honest across the refactor.

To accept an intentional behaviour change, re-record and commit the golden in the SAME commit
that changes behaviour, so the diff shows exactly which cases moved:

    python3 tests/characterize.py --record

The golden names the machine it was recorded on — `"user"` (from `getpass.getuser()`) and
`"hostname"`, both of which `collect_state` puts on the wire — and that is left exactly as it
is, on purpose. This file is a RECORDING, not a fixture somebody authored: editing values into
it by hand makes it disagree with what `--record` produces, which is the one property the net
has. The hand-written fixtures that DID name a machine (`tests/qr_ref.py`, and the QR digest
case in `tests/test_qr.py`) were the ones worth neutralising, and were.
