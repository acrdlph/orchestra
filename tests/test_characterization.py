"""The characterization snapshot, as a test, so CI enforces it.

See tests/characterize.py for why this exists: the unit suite monkeypatches module globals at
67 sites, and a module split silently disarms those patch points. This check patches nothing,
so it stays honest across the refactor.

To accept an intentional behaviour change, re-record and commit the golden in the SAME commit
that changes behaviour, so the diff shows exactly which cases moved:

    python3 tests/characterize.py --record

The golden used to name the machine it was recorded on — `"user"` (from `getpass.getuser()`)
and `"hostname"`, both of which `collect_state` puts on the wire. That was defended on the
grounds that this file is a RECORDING and hand-editing it would make it disagree with what
`--record` produces, which is the one property the net has. The defence was right and the
conclusion was wrong: a golden carrying one laptop's user name can only ever match on that
laptop, so **this check failed on every CI run from the day it was added** — and the first line
of this docstring says CI enforcing it is the whole point. A net that is always red is a net
nobody reads.

So the machine identity is normalised **at capture**, in `characterize._state_payload`, exactly
the way the temp path already was — not edited into the golden afterwards. The golden is still
precisely what `--record` emits, the keys are still compared, and a dropped or renamed field
still fails. What no longer fails is running the suite on a different computer.

The hand-written fixtures that DID name a machine (`tests/qr_ref.py`, and the QR digest case in
`tests/test_qr.py`) were neutralised earlier, for the same reason.
