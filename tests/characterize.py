"""Characterization harness — pins observable behaviour across a refactor.

The unit suite monkeypatches module globals (`fb.CFG`, `fb.git_info`, `fb._cache`, …) at 67
sites. That coupling is exactly what a module split breaks, and it breaks it *silently*: once
`collect_state` lives in `observer.py` and imports `git_info` by name, patching
`orchestra.git_info` stops having any effect and the test keeps passing while testing nothing.

So the unit suite cannot be its own safety net for this change. This harness is the net instead:

  * it patches NOTHING — it only calls public functions with explicit arguments,
  * it locates the code through `load_orchestra()`, which resolves either the single-file
    layout or the package layout, so the SAME harness runs on both sides of the split,
  * it records a golden JSON and compares against it, so "behaviour is identical" is a
    byte-comparison rather than an opinion.

Mutation-testing this harness: clear __pycache__ first. A same-size edit
(`+= 1` -> `+= 2`) within the same second leaves mtime and size unchanged, so
Python happily reuses the stale .pyc and the mutation appears to be "caught"
when it never ran at all. Observed here; it cost a confused half hour.

Usage:
    python3 tests/characterize.py --record     # before the refactor
    python3 tests/characterize.py              # after — must be byte-identical
    python3 -m unittest tests.test_characterization   # same check, as a test

Because it asserts on the public surface only, it also proves the package facade is complete:
if the split forgets to re-export something, loading fails here first.
