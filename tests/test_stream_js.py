"""`stream.js` — the browser's half of the state stream, checked without a browser.

`tests/test_observer.py` proves the SERVER's delta is sufficient, against a
reference applier written in Python. That proves nothing about the applier the
board actually runs, and the applier the board actually runs is the piece that
can be wrong in a way no test run would reveal and no amount of clicking would
either: a delta that quietly stops re-sorting, or quietly loses a loose process,
looks exactly like a fleet that did not change.

So this drives the SHIPPED file. `stream.js` exports `Fleet` and returns before
its worker half when loaded as a module, so node gets the real applier — not a
copy of it — fed by frames the real `Observer.delta_since` produced. Each step
is checked three ways: against the Python reference applier, against the
snapshot taken whole, and against what the board would actually draw.

Needs node only to run; it is skipped without one, and the Python-side contract
in test_observer.py stands on its own.
