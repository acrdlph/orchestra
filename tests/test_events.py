"""`GET /api/events` — the state stream (ADR 0005, ENGINE.md §5.2/§5.3).

Two harnesses, because the route has two halves that fail differently.

Most of this file drives `Handler` DIRECTLY, with a fake wire in place of the
socket: the handler object is built by hand, `do_GET` runs on a thread, and
every frame arrives on a queue. Nothing here waits on the clock to decide a
verdict — a frame either arrives before a generous timeout or the test fails,
and the interesting claims ("no frame when the version did not move") are made
as ORDERING assertions, which cannot be satisfied by waiting longer.

The rest boots a real `Server` on a real port, because three of the claims are
about the socket and cannot be faked: that a rude disconnect gives the thread
and the slot back, that a concurrent `GET /api/state` is not starved while
streams are held open, and that the bytes are genuinely incremental rather than
buffered until close.
