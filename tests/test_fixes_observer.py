"""Two concurrency fixes in orchestra/observer.py, each pinned by the
interleaving that used to lose.

* The lost wakeup: `_loop` read `_nudge_at` for the deadline and only THEN
  cleared `_wake`, so a nudge whose whole body ran between the read and the
  clear was erased outright — deadline computed pre-nudge, set() wiped — and
  the loop waited out the full cadence. The clear now happens before the
  read; because `nudge` writes `_nudge_at` before it sets the event, a nudge
  after the clear is either seen by the read or leaves the event set.

* The request-path cache clobber: `cached_state` wrote `_cache` blindly after
  its synchronous collect, stamping a fresh clock over a mutation's parked
  `_cache["t"] = 0.0` — after which the sweep's own compare-and-swap rightly
  refused to touch the cache and the polled board served pre-mutation state
  for up to `republish_s`. The request path now keeps the same CAS the sweep
  does, and serves the fresh state uncached when it loses.
