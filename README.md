**Mission control for parallel Claude Code agents — watch every worktree and
account on one board, chat with any agent, dispatch new missions, and land
finished ones.**

![orchestra](docs/social-preview-v2.png)

You're running Claude Code agents in five worktrees at once, across several
accounts. Which agent is working? Which one is waiting for an answer? Which
one silently hit a usage limit an hour ago? Which worktree is free for the
next feature — and on which account? orchestra answers all of it on one dark
board, and (when you click) acts on it too.

It's an agent harness that installs nothing — python3 stdlib only.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acrdlph/orchestra && cd orchestra
python3 -m orchestra --root ~/code        # → http://127.0.0.1:4242
```

Try it with nothing running: `python3 -m orchestra --demo` serves fictional
data.

## The three views

A left rail navigates between them; all share one visual language:
**green = activity**, **orange = needs you**, **yellow = limit**,
**cyan = free**.

### ⌗ Board — who needs me, and where can I put the next agent?

![the orchestra dashboard](docs/screenshot.png)

One card per worktree, attention-sorted, refreshed every 5 s — and the
engine behind it re-reads the world within ~50 ms of an agent writing a line,
rather than on a timer. Each card:
branch, dirty count, ahead/behind, last commit, live processes, and every
recent session tagged with its **account**, model, age, and three lines of
context — `→` the last thing you told it, `⏎` the last thing it said, `⚙` the
latest subagent report. Session statuses:

| badge | meaning |
|---|---|
| `● WORKING` | transcript (or a subagent's) written < 90 s ago |
| `▲ NEEDS ANSWER` | live process with a pending question for you |
| `⛔ LIMIT HIT` | parked on an exhausted account — binding limit + reset countdown shown |
| `■ BLOCKED` | live process stuck on an unresolved tool call |
| `◆ YOUR TURN` | live process idle at the prompt — the turn is finished |
| `○ ENDED` | recent transcript, but no live process behind it |

The header names the **FREE worktrees** — no live process, nothing mid-turn —
so "where do I point the next agent?" is answered before you ask.

**Lost the window an agent runs in?** Each session carries its own terminal
chip with tty and hosting app (`⌖ 38627 ttys024 Terminal`); click it and that
window jumps to the front (AppleScript for Terminal.app/iTerm2; editors get
activated with a pointer to the tty; tmux agents get the attach command). The
chip sits on the session row, not the card, so a worktree running three agents
says which window is which — sessions are matched to processes by the account
each one runs under. A dashed chip means the pairing fell back to a guess.

**One door into the fleet — the 🚀 new mission button.** Instead of picking a
worktree, checking which account has usage left, opening a terminal, and
choosing a model by hand, you type what to build and orchestra routes it:

![mission dispatch flow](docs/mission-flow.png)

(Details in [Acting on the fleet](#acting-on-the-fleet) below.)

### ⌁ Map — where every branch really is

![the branch map](docs/map.png)

One trunk per repo (`origin/main`), and every worktree placed at its true git
position: branches leave the trunk at their real merge-base and run to their
tip on a **log time scale ending at "now"**; worktrees whose HEAD sits on main
ride the trunk at the exact commit they're parked on. A tip short of the right
edge is a branch that stopped moving; a long flat arc `↓137` behind is rebase
debt as literal distance. Dots are commits, tips take live status colors (a
working agent's tip pulses), hover for details, click a node for actions
(⌖ focus its terminal · ✓ finish the mission).

### ◔ Limits — is the agent stuck, or out of juice?

![the limits view](docs/limits.png)

Every account side by side via [cclimits](https://github.com/acrdlph/cclimits):
headroom, per-limit usage bars, reset countdowns, ⛔ EXHAUSTED flags, and a
◇ MOST HEADROOM pick for your next agent. Exhausted accounts also feed back
into the board: their parked sessions flip to `⛔ LIMIT HIT` instead of
masquerading as "your turn" (the CLI's "out of usage credits" transcript
notice is a cache-independent fallback signal).

**Polling discipline:** limits are cached server-side for 5 minutes on top of
cclimits' own cache; a network refetch happens **only** when you click "force
refetch". Nothing polls the Anthropic API on a timer.

---

## Acting on the fleet

- **✉ chat** — every session opens a drawer: the conversation is read from
  the transcript; your reply is typed straight into the agent's terminal
  (tmux `send-keys`; AppleScript for Terminal.app/iTerm2 — grant the
  Automation permission when macOS asks; editor-embedded terminals are
  read-only). No more hunting windows to answer an agent.
- **▶ resume** — a session-limit-stuck agent gets a button with a live
  countdown that **arms itself the moment the limit resets**, then types
  `continue`. Weekly limits never show it — they won't heal soon.
- **⏱ auto** — or don't wait up for the reset at all: one click **schedules
  the resume** for 1 minute after the limit resets (the armed chip opens a
  drawer to pick another delay, an exact time, or disarm). At the armed
  moment the server re-checks the limit via cclimits — still exhausted →
  it re-arms for the fresh reset; clear → it types `continue` into the
  session's own terminal, and when no terminal can be scripted (Cursor/
  VS Code, or the window is gone) it reopens the conversation in a fleet
  tmux session via `claude --resume` and resumes it there. Schedules live
  in `resume.schedule.json`, so they survive a server restart — resets at
  3am and weekly limits days out are equally fine.

  ![auto-resume flow: one click arms it, the schedule survives restarts, the reset is verified, the agent continues](docs/auto-resume.png)
- **✓ finish** — one click, exactly as much closeout as is left: an unlanded
  branch gets the full closeout brief (typed at the live agent, or run by a
  one-shot closeout agent that frees the card by itself); an already-landed
  one gets a slim brief — or no agent at all: orchestra parks the worktree
  back on the trunk itself. A brief typed at a live agent flips the button
  to **✕ close** — the explicit second step that verifies the landing and
  exits the agent. See *Closing out a mission* below.
- **🚀 new mission** — describe a feature; orchestra picks the worktree and
  account **deterministically** — the cleanest free worktree, the account
  with the most headroom that can run your model — no AI in the routing loop,
  so the auto preview always names the worktree that actually launches, and
  a busy worktree can never be picked. It then launches a tmux-hosted agent:
  `tmux -L fleet attach -t mission-…` from any terminal, and it appears on
  the board like any other agent. **Your mission text is never rewritten** —
  the agent receives a deterministic operational header (branch, commit
  discipline) followed by the author's words verbatim, and names its own
  branch. Every dispatch is logged to `dispatch.log.jsonl` (gitignored) for
  auditing.
  **Model & effort are yours to pick** — judging a mission's difficulty is
  the one thing rules can't do, so nothing guesses it for you; the composer
  refuses to launch until both are chosen.
  Picking a model checks that model's *own* limit
  per account (Fable can be gone while the weekly limit is fine); if no
  account clears its reserve buffer for it, the dispatch pauses with a dialog
  offering **Opus** instead (or use it anyway) rather than launching blindly.
  Model is a launch flag; effort is typed as `/effort <level>`
  into the new session and **verified** via capture-pane (⚠ shown if
  unconfirmed). Caveat: the CLI saves non-ultracode effort levels as that
  account's default for new sessions — dispatching with an explicit effort
  updates that account's default too.

### Handoffs across accounts

The pattern that makes a multi-account fleet work:

![one branch, three accounts, zero downtime](docs/orchestration.png)

An agent burns its account down, writes a handoff doc (drop to a cheaper model
for that), and an agent on a different account picks the branch up. orchestra
understands the succession: a limit-hit session with a fresher live session in
its worktree is annotated **"↳ work continued by [account] — this terminal can
be closed"**, leaves the need-you counts, and stops speaking for the branch on
the map. Only a stranded agent with *no* successor keeps demanding attention.

### Closing out a mission

One button: **✓ finish**, on every worktree card and in a map node's panel.
It arms on the first click, runs on the second, and — like everything
orchestra does — works by talking to a terminal:

![one button lands it](docs/finish-flow.png)

- **agent alive** → it receives a closeout brief: land the branch on the
  trunk (merge, resolve, push), tidy the worktree, report back — and the
  button flips to **✕ close**, step two. Once the agent reports done,
  ✕ close verifies the landing and types `/exit`, closing the terminal;
  pressed early, it refuses and names what's still unverified — it never
  re-types the brief at an agent that may be mid-closeout. Merged to the
  trunk from the terminal yourself already? The brief shrinks to match —
  settle background work, tidy scratch, park on the trunk; nothing already
  merged is re-checked.
- **terminal already gone** → a one-shot closeout agent (headless
  `claude -p --model haiku` — the work is mechanical git, no judgment needed)
  runs the right-sized brief, then git itself verifies the landing: verified
  clean → the process ends and the card frees itself, no second click;
  anything else → the session reopens interactively **on the account's
  default model** (the resume is deliberately unpinned, so failure escalates
  past haiku) and the card parks as *needs you* — a failed closeout never
  masquerades as free.
- **terminal gone, branch already landed, worktree clean** → no agent at
  all: orchestra switches the worktree back to the trunk and pulls. Two git
  commands don't need an agent — the one place the board runs git write
  commands itself, because a landed branch and a clean tree make them
  provably safe. Any leftover file, even scratch, still goes to an agent:
  whether it's droppable is a judgment call.
- **everything landed, agent idle** → `/exit` is typed and the terminal
  closes.

Then wait a few seconds: the session flips to `○ ENDED` and the card returns
to `◇ FREE` by itself — free is observed (no live process, no fresh
transcript writes), never set by hand.

The board serves the full operating manual at **`/guide`** — status
vocabulary, mission lifecycle, what the closeout brief asks the agent to do,
and the gotchas.

## Setup

**Requirements:** python3 (stdlib only) and `git`. macOS gets full terminal
integration (focus/typing via AppleScript); Linux gets everything except
that, with `/proc`-based process detection. Optional: `tmux` (dispatch),
[cclimits](https://github.com/acrdlph/cclimits) (limits view),
`claude` on PATH (dispatch router).

```bash
python3 -m orchestra [--root DIR]... [--pattern REGEX] [--home DIR]...
                      [--port N] [--window-h H] [--idle-s S] [--demo]
./start.sh            # restart + open browser (extra args passed through)
```

| flag | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--root DIR` | cwd | directory whose git-repo children are watched (repeatable) |
| `--pattern REGEX` | all | only watch child dirs matching this (case-insensitive) |
| `--home DIR` | auto | Claude home dirs; default finds `~/.claude*` |
| `--port N` | 4242 | also `ORCHESTRA_PORT` env |
| `--host ADDR` | 127.0.0.1 | bind address. Anything but loopback needs a registered device; `0.0.0.0` is refused outright |
| `--tailnet` | — | detect the Tailscale address and bind it — the flag to reach the board from a phone |
| `--bind-every-interface` | — | what `--host 0.0.0.0` was refused for, said deliberately. Still needs a registered device; a config file cannot set it |
| `--add-device LABEL` | — | mint a device token, printed **once** — then exit |
| `--list-devices` | — | every registered device, with `last_seen` — then exit |
| `--revoke-device ID` | — | kill a token immediately, no restart needed — then exit |
| `--window-h H` | 48 | ignore transcripts idle longer than this many hours |
| `--idle-s S` | 30.0 | seconds between **safety-net** sweeps; changes arrive as events (see below) |
| `--disk-report` | — | print what the transcript corpus costs (read-only) — then exit |
| `--prune-logs` | — | rotate/reap **orchestra's own** logs; never touches `~/.claude*` — then exit |
| `--demo` | — | fictional data (screenshots, kicking the tires) |

### Keeping it running (launchd, macOS)

`./start.sh` is for a board you open and close. To have one waiting whenever you
log in, `contrib/sh.orchestra.server.plist` is a **user LaunchAgent** template —
it runs as you, in your GUI session, which is what reading `~/.claude*` and
scripting Terminal.app both need. Replace the four CAPITALISED placeholders
(python3, the checkout, your code root, your home — launchd expands `~` nowhere),
then:

```bash
cp contrib/sh.orchestra.server.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID ~/Library/LaunchAgents/sh.orchestra.server.plist
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/sh.orchestra.server   # restart after an edit
launchctl bootout gui/$UID/sh.orchestra.server        # stop and unload
```

`bootstrap`/`bootout`, not `load`/`unload`: the legacy pair still works and
still lies — it reports success for a job it never started. `RunAtLoad` +
`KeepAlive` keep the server up; stdout and stderr both land in
`~/Library/Logs/orchestra.log`.

**`--tailnet` fails closed at boot, and that is the point.** It *detects* the
Tailscale address rather than trusting a pasted one, so if the daemon has not
come up yet there is no address to bind and the server exits saying so rather
than binding something else. At login that race is normal. `KeepAlive` is
unconditional for exactly this reason — launchd retries every
`ThrottleInterval` (30 s in the template) until Tailscale is up, and the log
shows one refusal per attempt until it is.

Persistent settings go in `orchestra.config.json` next to the script
(gitignored). **Copy `orchestra.config.example.json` to start** — it lists every
key with placeholder values, including the `apns_*` keys for iOS push:

```json
{ "roots": ["/Users/you/code"], "pattern": "myproject", "cclimits_cmd": null,
  "exclude_accounts": [], "router_home": null, "reserve_percent": {"main": 20},
  "idle_s": 30.0, "git_s": 15.0 }
```

**Secrets and where they live** — nothing sensitive is committed; each has a
`.example` template so a fresh checkout knows the shape:

| secret | real (gitignored) | template (committed) |
|---|---|---|
| server config | `orchestra.config.json` | `orchestra.config.example.json` |
| iOS device-signing team | `ios/Signing.xcconfig` | `ios/Signing.xcconfig.example` |
| APNs push key | `~/.orchestra/apns/AuthKey_*.p8` (outside the repo) | — see `docs/mobile/APNS-SETUP.md` |

The `apns_*` keys (`apns_team_id`, `apns_key_id`, `apns_key_path`, `apns_topic`,
`apns_environment`) are only needed for push to the iOS app;
[`docs/mobile/APNS-SETUP.md`](docs/mobile/APNS-SETUP.md) is the ten-minute
walk-through for creating the key. All three — the App ID, the key, and
`apns_team_id` — must belong to the **same** Apple team, or Apple rejects the
provider token with `403 InvalidProviderToken`.

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `roots` | `[cwd]` | dirs whose git-repo children are watched |
| `pattern` | `""` | regex filter on worktree dir names |
| `homes` | `[]` | Claude home dirs; `[]` auto-discovers `~/.claude*` |
| `host` / `port` | `127.0.0.1` / `4242` | the board serves your transcript text. Off loopback it refuses to start until a device is registered (`--add-device`), and refuses `0.0.0.0` outright |
| `auth_trust_loopback` | `true` | requests from this machine need no token. Set false only if something proxies to the board — a proxy makes every peer look local |
| `session_window_h` | `48` | ignore transcripts idle longer than this |
| `quiet_s` | `45` | unexplained silence before a live agent stops reading WORKING |
| `flicker_dwell_s` | `3.0` | a status must stand this long before it may quieten; escalation never waits |
| `block_grace_s` | `60` | how long an unresolved tool_use is a tool **running** before it is you it is waiting for (■ BLOCKED) |
| `orphan_grace_s` | `90` | how long a fresh write with **no** visible process is still WORKING rather than ○ ENDED — the dangerous one: ENDED makes a worktree FREE, and FREE is what dispatch aims at |
| `delegated_s` | `600` | shelf life of a background launch that never reported back, as an explanation for a quiet session |
| `subagent_grace_s` | `180` | how long after the last write under `<session-id>/` the card still shows **⚙ subagents running** |
| `working_s` | `90` | the fallback the four keys above are `None`-defaulted to. Nothing on the board reaches it any more — every call site names the clock it means. Change one of those instead |
| `max_sessions` | `6` | sessions shown per worktree card |
| `exclude_accounts` | `[]` | account labels dispatch/router never **auto**-picks |
| `reserve_percent` | `{}` | `{label: pct}` headroom kept free before AUTO-pick treats an account as full |
| `cclimits_cmd` / `router_home` | `null` | override the limits binary / pin the router to one Claude home |
| `resume_delay_s` | `60` | auto-resume fires this long after a limit reset |
| `resume_message` | `"continue"` | what auto-resume types at the stalled agent |
| **the sweep's cadences** | | *costs measured below; all are seconds* |
| `idle_s` | `30.0` | between **safety-net** sweeps — see "how the board notices" below |
| `idle_blind_s` | `3.0` | ceiling on that wait when there is no watcher (Linux, or one that died) |
| `hot_s` | `0.15` | floor between sweeps after a **mutation**, so a burst can't spin the loop |
| `git_s` | `15.0` | minimum between `git` fan-outs |
| `reconcile_s` | `60.0` | how often a sweep goes cold: bypass every cache, count the disagreements |
| `max_stale_s` | `45.0` | hard ceiling between sweeps — **keep this ≥ `idle_s`**, or it silently becomes the cadence |
| **the watcher** (macOS) | | *what makes `idle_s` a safety net rather than the mechanism* |
| `watch` | `true` | react to transcript writes instead of polling for them |
| `watch_max_fds` | `2048` | hard cap on watched descriptors; over it the excess falls back to the timer |
| `watch_debounce_s` | `0.05` | quiet period that ends a burst — an agent writing 50 lines is **one** sweep |
| `watch_min_interval_s` | `1.0` | floor between event-driven sweeps (the rate limit; see below) |
| `watch_max_window_s` | `2.0` | never defer a nudge longer than this, however busy the writer |
| `watch_rebuild_s` | `30.0` | re-enumerate the watch set on this clock, as well as on every change |
| **disk** | | *the board reports what your transcripts cost; it never deletes them — see below* |
| `disk_report_h` | `6.0` | hours between corpus reports; `0` turns the thread off |
| `disk_warn_gb` | `10.0` | warn once `~/.claude*/projects` is bigger than this |
| `disk_free_gb` | `10.0` | …or once the filesystem holding it has less than this free |
| `log_max_mb` | `8.0` | rotate **orchestra's own** `audit.log.jsonl` / `dispatch.log.jsonl` past this |
| `log_keep` | `5` | rotated segments kept — but a segment under **7 days** old is never removed, whatever this says |

**How the board notices (macOS).** It does not go looking. A kqueue watcher
holds a deliberately bounded set of file descriptors — the project directories
that map to one of your worktrees, and the transcripts inside your session
window — and the moment one of them is written to, the sweep runs. Measured on
a nine-worktree fleet that is **228 descriptors**: 1 root, 8 `projects` roots,
164 project and session directories, 55 in-window transcripts. Never the
18,773 subagent files; over `watch_max_fds` the excess quietly falls back to
the timer and says so once in the log.

A burst is one sweep, not fifty: writes are debounced (`watch_debounce_s`) and
then rate-limited (`watch_min_interval_s`), because events remove the sweep's
floor *and* its ceiling, and the ceiling is the dangerous half — an agent
writing continuously would otherwise sweep several times a second.

Three things the watcher **cannot** see, which is what `idle_s` is now for:
a `claude` process being **born** (kqueue has a filter for process death, none
for birth), an append to a transcript that had already fallen out of the 48 h
window, and a subagent file more than one directory deep. Those wait for a
safety-net sweep. And on Linux — no stdlib inotify binding — the watcher never
starts, one line is logged, and the loop falls back to `idle_blind_s` (3.0),
which is exactly how this program behaved before.

**What the cadences cost.** orchestra watches continuously, so the board hears
that an agent needs you without anybody refreshing anything. That is a real,
permanent CPU cost, which is why it is a setting and why here is the bill.
Measured on a nine-worktree fleet (709 transcripts on disk, ~47 inside the
48 h window), 120 s per row, with `getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF) + RUSAGE_CHILDREN` —
wall time and `ps -o time` on the server process both understate this by ~2×,
because the sweep is a parallel fan-out and most of its cost is billed to the
`git` and `ps` children it spawns. One knob varies per row; the rest are at
their defaults:

**Nothing happening at all** — no agent writing anywhere, three interleaved
repetitions per row so machine load cancels rather than favouring one:

| | | CPU (1 core = 100 %) | sweeps / git runs | what you trade |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `watch` + `idle_s` | **`true` + `30.0`** | **6 %** | 4 / 4 | the default |
| | `true` + `60.0` | 3 % | 2 / 2 | 3 points, for twice the blind spot below |
| | `false` + `3.0` | 14 % | 40 / 8 | the timer-only loop this replaces |
| `git_s` | `5.0` | 29 % | 40 / 20 | branch/ahead/behind/dirty ≤5 s old |
| | **`15.0`** | **17 %** | 40 / 8 | *(measured at the old `idle_s` 3.0)* |
| | `60.0` | 9 % | 40 / 2 | a dirty count can be a minute stale |
| `reconcile_s` | **`60.0`** | **17 %** | 40 / 8 | *(same)* |
| | off | 16 % | 40 / 8 | saves ~1 point; nothing audits the caches |

**And with one agent actually working**, which is the regime that decides
`idle_s`, because idle it barely matters:

| `idle_s` (watcher on) | CPU | sweeps | of which event-driven |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`30.0`** | **7 %** | 8 | 6 |
| `15.0` | 10 % | 15 | 11 |
| `5.0` | 15 % | 35 | 17 |

Read the last column downward. Tightening `idle_s` from 30 to 5 buys 27 extra
sweeps and 8 points of CPU, and **every one of those sweeps found something the
events had already reported**. Before the watcher, that column did not exist
and polling harder was the only dial there was.

Two more things worth more than the numbers.

**The watcher pays twice.** Idle cost falls **14 % → 6 %** *and* a transcript
write reaches the board in **53 ms** instead of waiting out a cadence (median
of ten writes; 212 ms through to a published version, since the sweep follows).
Latency and battery usually trade against each other; this is the one change
that moved both.

**`git_s` is still the expensive knob, not `idle_s`.** The `git` fan-out is
79 % of a sweep's cost, which is why tripling the git rate (15 → 5) costs 12
points on its own. And note what a *watch* nudge deliberately does **not** do:
it does not force git off its cadence. A mutation you performed does; an agent
typing does not, or git would run at the speed of somebody's keyboard.

Every budget above is for changes **nobody told the board about**. Every
mutation you make (finish, dispatch, chat) nudges the sweep, which pulls the
next one forward *and* forces git off its cadence, so you never wait out
`git_s` for your own actions. And nothing is ever silently stale: each card
publishes how old its git data is.

`exclude_accounts` names accounts (by label) that dispatch/router will never
**auto**-pick — useful for keeping a primary account (e.g. `main` = `~/.claude`)
out of automated launches so a stale token there can't hijack a browser login.
`router_home` pins the one-shot haiku router to a single known-good Claude home
instead of rotating across accounts. `reserve_percent` keeps a headroom buffer
free per account (`{"main": 20}` = never auto-dispatch onto `main` once it drops
below 20% left; `"*"` sets a default for all). The router is told which accounts
are reserve-blocked and treats them as full. Manual selection can still target
any account.

Worktrees are discovered as immediate children of each root that are git
repositories (a `<dir>/repo` layout is also recognized).

**Multi-account setups** follow the cclimits conventions: any `~/.claude` or
`~/.claude-*` directory containing `projects/` is auto-discovered and named
after its suffix (`~/.claude-work` → `work`, bare `~/.claude` → `main`).
Non-standard locations: `--home DIR`, the config file's `"homes"`, or a
colon-separated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIRS`. See the cclimits README for setting up
accounts via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.

### Disk — orchestra reports, you decide

Your transcripts are the biggest thing on this machine that this program
touches, and **orchestra never deletes any of them.** There is no backup job
and no derived copy: `transcripts.py` opens `~/.claude*/projects` read-only,
reads a bounded tail, and writes nothing. Retention there is yours.

What it does instead is tell you what it costs, every `disk_report_h` hours and
once at startup, on stderr (`/tmp/orchestra.log` under `./start.sh`) — or on
demand, which is read-only and safe to run any time:

```bash
python3 -m orchestra --disk-report
# orchestra: transcript corpus 4.9 GB in 35,373 files across 7 Claude home(s);
#            oldest write 193 days ago; 13.4 GB free on that filesystem.
```

Past `disk_warn_gb`, or under `disk_free_gb` free, it also names the oldest file
and how to list the old ones. **This matters more than it sounds:** a full disk
does not slow the board down, it stops an agent writing its `.jsonl` at all —
and a session with no transcript is one the board cannot read. That is a real
incident here, not a hypothetical (a busy worktree cried "needs you" because of
it). To reclaim space, look first, then delete what you recognise:

```bash
find ~/.claude*/projects -name '*.jsonl' -mtime +90 -print
```

The two append-only files orchestra writes **itself** — `audit.log.jsonl` and
`dispatch.log.jsonl` — are the only files it will ever remove, and only these:

```bash
python3 -m orchestra --prune-logs
```

They rotate past `log_max_mb` into a stamped segment beside them
(`audit.log.jsonl.20260804T005712`), `log_keep` segments survive, and every
batch that removes something writes a `disk_prune` line into the audit log with
the count and the bytes freed. **A segment less than 7 days old is never
removed, whatever `log_keep` says** — the week just gone is when somebody
investigating a stolen token goes looking, and that floor is not a config key.
Both readers (`/api/dispatchlog`, `read_audit`) stitch across the boundary, so a
rotation never looks like a wiped history.

## How it works

- **Sessions** — tail-parses the last 128 KB of each
  `<claude-home>/projects/<munged-cwd>/*.jsonl` transcript, skipping subagent
  sidechains; topics come from the compaction summary or first real prompt,
  with slash-command stubs, ANSI noise, and harness chatter filtered out.
- **Subagents & workflows** — a session running a Workflow writes to
  `<session-id>/**/*.jsonl` while its main transcript sits untouched;
  orchestra counts that activity toward liveness (⚙ indicator) and surfaces
  the newest subagent report, so multi-agent sessions never misreport as idle.
- **Liveness** — `ps` for `claude` processes, cwds via one `lsof` call
  (macOS/BSD) or `/proc/<pid>/cwd` (Linux). N live processes under a worktree
  vouch for its N freshest sessions; everything staler is ENDED, so dead
  transcripts can't masquerade as waiting agents.
- **Mapping** — transcript project dirs match worktrees by munged-path
  prefix, longest prefix wins (`myapp` doesn't swallow `myapp-audit`).
- **Terminal actuation** — tmux targets are resolved by walking process
  ancestry to the owning pane; Terminal.app/iTerm2 tabs are matched by tty.

## Tests

Pure stdlib `unittest`, zero dependencies — same as the app:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests     # from the repo root
```

**Unit tests** (`tests/test_orchestra.py`) cover the logic that's easy to get
wrong: transcript text cleaning and the real-vs-machine prompt filter, account
labelling, longest-prefix worktree matching, session-status classification
(working / needs-input / limit / blocked / your-turn / ended), per-model
headroom + reserve buffers, the reserve-persist round-trip, dispatch-log
parsing, and an HTTP smoke test that boots the real server in `--demo` mode
and hits every endpoint.

**Auth tests** (`tests/test_auth.py`, `tests/test_pairing.py`) come in three
shapes because the claims do: the decision (`auth.check` with an explicit peer,
header and clock — every refusal in the design is one row), the wire (a real
server on a real port whose handler believes its peer is on the tailnet, which
is what proves the check is in the request path rather than merely in a
function), and the routes — read back out of `server.py`'s own AST *and* out of
the guard's own admin list, each required to be exempt-by-list or to refuse a
stranger, so a route added later cannot start out unguarded and a hard-coded
list cannot rot.

The route tests also ask, **holding a valid token**, that no `/api/v1` route can
be reached by gluing a character onto it. That one is not theoretical: the
router matched the device subtree with `startswith("/api/v1/devices")` while the
guard stopped at a segment boundary, so `GET /api/v1/devicesX` was refused at the
exact path and served the whole device inventory one character to the right of
it — and `POST /api/v1/devicesX/<id>/revoke` let any token holder revoke any
device. Both halves had a test and neither could see the gap, because neither
asked the other one anything. The router and the guard now call the same
function.

**Integration tests** (`tests/test_integration.py`) exercise the *real*
pipeline against controlled fixtures — no dependency on your live fleet:

- a temp **git repo** + a temp **Claude home** with real `.jsonl` transcripts,
  run through the actual `discover_worktrees` → `git_info` → `scan_sessions` →
  `collect_state` path (branch, dirty count, topic extraction, fresh-vs-ended
  status, pending-workflow reporting). Live-system inputs (`ps`/`lsof`,
  `cclimits`) are stubbed to empty so the git + transcript code runs for real.
- `branch_topology` against a repo with a real `origin/main` ref (fork point,
  ahead/behind).
- the **tmux actuation** layer (`send-keys` + `capture-pane`) that dispatch,
  chat, resume, and effort-verification depend on — on its own socket, with a
  plain shell, never launching `claude`.

Tests self-skip where a tool is missing (`git`, `tmux`). What stays manual:
the real `claude`/`cclimits`/AppleScript calls — verified by driving a live
dispatch (kickoff → READY → instruction → DONE).

## Security & spending

- **The board serves your prompts and your agents' replies.** It binds to
  127.0.0.1 by default. Loopback is trusted — a process that can open that
  socket is already running as you and can read `~/.claude*` without asking
  this server — so the browser needs no token. **Everything else must present
  one:**

  ```bash
  python3 -m orchestra --add-device "iPhone"   # prints the token ONCE
  python3 -m orchestra --list-devices
  python3 -m orchestra --revoke-device 9f3ab21c
  ```

  The token goes in `Authorization: Bearer orc1_…` — never a query parameter,
  never a cookie; both are refused. Exactly two routes need no token:
  `GET /api/health`, which carries nothing that varies with your fleet, and
  `POST /api/v1/pair`. Devices live in `devices.json` as sha256 hashes compared
  with `hmac.compare_digest`, so a copy of that file is not a way in, and every
  mutation and every refusal is appended to `audit.log.jsonl` — who, what, when,
  never what was said, and never anything token-shaped, whichever field it
  arrived in.

- **To reach it from a phone, `--tailnet`.** The Tailscale address is detected
  and then actually bound on port 0 to prove it, rather than pasted from a
  stale document; if Tailscale is down you get one of three sentences saying
  which failure it is, not `EADDRNOTAVAIL`. `--host 0.0.0.0` is refused and
  names `--tailnet` in the refusal — the escape hatch is
  `--bind-every-interface`, which cannot be typed by accident and which a
  config file cannot set. **Nothing beyond loopback binds at all until a device
  is registered**, including the wide one; it used to warn and bind anyway.
  A tailnet bind also raises a second listener on 127.0.0.1, because device
  management answers to this machine holding *no* token — and a request the Mac
  sends to its own tailnet address does not arrive from loopback.

- **Pairing a phone is a QR, and the QR is not the token.** `/pair` on the board
  mints an 8-character Crockford code, valid 120 seconds, single use, which the
  phone exchanges at `POST /api/v1/pair` for a fresh secret that was never on
  screen — so a photograph of the code, or a screenshot in a bug report, is
  worthless by the time it leaves the room. Device management (`/api/v1/devices`)
  answers only to the Mac holding no token: **no token grants it, not even a
  valid one**, because a device that could revoke devices could revoke the one
  that would have revoked it.
- **A website you visit cannot drive your fleet.** Mutations must be sent as
  `Content-Type: application/json` and a cross-site `Origin` is refused, which
  is what stops another page borrowing your browser's loopback trust to type
  at an agent. If you script the API by hand, send that header.
- **Actions type into your terminals.** Chat/resume literally keystroke the
  target terminal — same as you typing. They fire only on your click.
- **Dispatch spends usage.** A launched agent runs
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (nobody is at its prompt to approve
  tools), and the optional router is one extra `claude -p` haiku call.
  Nothing launches, resumes, or refetches limits on its own.

## Caveats

- The transcript format is an undocumented Claude Code internal (tested
  against v2.1.x); statuses are honest heuristics, not ground truth.
- BLOCKED / YOUR TURN are inferred **for agents orchestra did not launch** —
  permission prompts aren't recorded in transcripts. Agents dispatched *by*
  orchestra get a `--settings` fragment that POSTs Claude Code's own hooks to
  the board, and their statuses are observed instead: a permission dialog reads
  ■ BLOCKED within a couple of seconds of appearing rather than after
  `block_grace_s`, and those sessions carry a dim `◦` on the board. orchestra
  never writes your `settings.json`; an agent you started yourself has no hooks
  and reads exactly as it always did.
- Each clone's `origin/main` is only as fresh as its last `git fetch`; the
  map's trunk uses the freshest clone's view.
- Handoff detection reads "fresher live session in the same worktree" as
  succession — starting unrelated new work next to a limit-parked agent will
  be labeled a handoff.
