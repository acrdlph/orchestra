# orchestra for iOS — phases 1–4

A native SwiftUI client for the orchestra board.

* **Phase 1** got a token onto the phone and drew the Fleet list from a real
  server.
* **Phase 2** made the board **live**: one `GET /api/events` socket, deltas
  applied by a port of `stream.js`'s applier, ages animated locally off absolute
  timestamps, a connection state that is honest about staleness, a lifecycle that
  drops the stream on background and resyncs on foreground, and the read-only
  screens the IA calls for — worktree detail, session chat, limits, account
  detail, server.
* **Phase 3** made it **act**: reply to an agent (`/api/send`), launch a mission
  (`/api/dispatch`), the two-step closeout (`/api/finish`), and arm / disarm /
  manually fire an auto-resume (`/api/resume/*`). Every refusal is the server's
  own sentence, verbatim. Proven end to end on 2026-07-22: a message typed in the
  simulator reached a real agent on the Mac, the agent replied, and the app's
  transcript carried `✓✓ sent from this phone` on that exact turn.

* **Phase 4** turned push on: the app asks for authorization, registers its APNs
  token against the paired device (and re-registers when it rotates or the
  timezone moves), renders a preferences screen that writes the server's own
  preference store, deep-links a tap to the exact session it is about, and — the
  one that matters — answers an agent from the banner's inline reply, addressed by
  `sid` alone. Proven on 2026-07-23 against a real server and a booted simulator:
  registration reached the server (a token on file, `sandbox`, tz and app
  version); a `session.needs_answer` payload deep-linked to that session's
  conversation; and an inline reply reached `/api/send` and typed into the live
  agent (`{"ok": true, "message": "typed into Terminal (ttys010)"}`). See
  "Phase 4 — push" below for what only an APNs key, and only a physical device,
  can add.

## Build and run it — the only way this is verified

Everything below runs from a shell. No Xcode GUI, no Apple ID, no team.

```sh
# 1. the headless suites — models, transport classification, rules, formatters
cd ios && swift test                    # 96 tests, ~1 s, macOS, no simulator

# 2. the app
xcodebuild -project ios/Orchestra.xcodeproj -scheme Orchestra \
           -configuration Debug \
           -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro Max' \
           -derivedDataPath /tmp/orc-dd build

# 3. put it on a simulator
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 17 Pro Max"
xcrun simctl install booted /tmp/orc-dd/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Orchestra.app

# 4. pair it against a real server, then LOOK at what it drew
python3 -m orchestra --port 4269 --tailnet          # in the engine checkout
curl -s -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}' \
     http://127.0.0.1:4269/api/v1/devices/pair/open | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["url"])'
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_PAIR_URL='orc://p?h=…&p=4269&c=…' \
     xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
xcrun simctl io booted screenshot /tmp/board.png

# 5. every OTHER screen, without a finger
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=server                     xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=limits                     xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=limits:default             xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=wt:ConfidAI2               xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=chat:ConfidAI2/account2/<sid>  xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app

# 6. drive it: cause a real change and watch the board move
touch ~/.claude-account2/projects/*/<sid>.jsonl     # → delta on the wire in ~1 s

# 7. phase 3 — every sheet, and a real send, without a finger
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=mission                     xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=finish:ConfidAi7            xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=resume:ConfidAi7/<sid>      xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=chat:ConfidAi7/account4/<sid> \
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SEND='reply with exactly the words: the phone reached you' \
     xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
```

`ORC_SEND` is the third `#if DEBUG` seam and the sharpest one: it takes text
through exactly `ChatStore.send` — the same call the arrow button makes — because
the gate for phase 3 is *something actually arrived at a real agent* and a
simulator cannot be typed into from a script. It is a way to press the button,
not a second way to send. `ORC_SCREEN=finish:` and `resume:` are the same idea
for sheets, which `xcrun simctl` has no other way to reach at all.

`ORC_SCREEN` is the second `#if DEBUG` seam and it exists for the same reason as
the first: **a phase ends with the app run and LOOKED at**, and `xcrun simctl`
can install, launch and screenshot but cannot tap. An accessibility-driven click
is not a way out either — System Events answers `-25204` without a permission
grant a headless run does not have. So every screen gets one scriptable way in,
pushing exactly the `FleetRoute` values a tap pushes, through exactly the same
`navigationDestination`.

`ORC_PAIR_URL` is a **`#if DEBUG` test seam**, and it exists because a simulator
has no camera and cannot be typed into from a script — `xcrun simctl openurl`
does reach the app, but iOS puts a system *"Open in orchestra?"* dialog in front
of it that needs a finger. It takes the same `PairingTicket` through the same
`PairingStore.pair` as the camera and the typed form. It is a way to press the
button, not a second way to pair.

**IBM Plex Mono is bundled now** — the brand face of the desktop board, not SF
Mono approximating it. **Four `.ttf`s and no more.** `UI/Typography.swift`
resolves the mono half of the ramp from `\.legibilityWeight`, so Regular and
SemiBold carry normal legibility and Medium and Bold carry the system Bold Text
setting — which `Font.custom(_:size:relativeTo:)` does not honour on its own, and
without which the machine voice would stay thin while the human voice went bold.
That mapping is the only reason four faces ship instead of two; no italic, and
none of Plex's other six weights, because each unused face is ~170 KB of download
nothing renders. Every token still passes `relativeTo:` with the default point
size of the text style it already used, so Dynamic Type is unchanged and so is
the size at every step. **`App/Fonts/` needs no `.pbxproj` edit** — `App/` is a
file-system-synchronised group, the copy phase flattens the folder, `UIAppFonts`
therefore lists bare basenames, and `OFL.txt` ships beside the faces because the
SIL Open Font License requires the licence to travel with the font.

**Two silent-failure modes are guarded rather than hoped about** (`UX.md` §9.4).
`Font.custom` with a name nothing resolves does not throw and does not draw tofu
— it substitutes, invisibly. So: the PostScript names are read off the shipped
files and two of the four are *abbreviated* (`IBMPlexMono-Medm`,
`IBMPlexMono-SmBld`, and Regular is bare `IBMPlexMono`), and `OrcFont.plexIsAvailable`
resolves all four through `UIFont(name:)` at launch — `assertionFailure` in
DEBUG, and in Release the **whole** ramp falls back to the system monospaced
design, never per glyph. And Plex Mono has no Greek block at all, so §9.4's claim
that `Δ` U+0394 is "covered" is simply wrong: the dirty badge now draws `∆`
U+2206 (same shape, actually present) and the close button an SF Symbol instead
of `✕` U+2715. `FontBundleTests` re-checks the filenames, the PostScript names
and the glyph coverage of every mark drawn in mono on every `swift test`.

**The receive path, end to end.** `OrchestraClient.openEvents` opens the socket
and hands `Data` chunks to `SSELineSplitter` → `SSEDecoder` → `StreamFrame` →
`FleetApplier` → `FleetStore` → the views. Everything that can be wrong in a way
no amount of tapping would reveal — the line splitter, the SSE state machine, the
delta rules, the staleness rule — is a value type with no I/O and no clock, and
is covered by the 29 tests phase 2 added.

**`FleetApplier` is a PORT of `stream.js`'s `Fleet`, not a second
interpretation.** That file is the browser's applier, it is tested against the
Python reference (`tests/test_stream_js.py`), and it is what the desktop board
runs today. Two appliers that disagree about one rule produce two boards that
disagree about the fleet, and the disagreement is invisible until it matters. So
every rule in `FleetApplier` names the lines of `stream.js` it comes from.

**One module, not IOS-APP.md §1.2's six.** The layering there is enforced by the
SwiftPM graph — `OrchestraCore` structurally cannot see `OrchestraStore` — and
that is the right shape. It is deliberately not bought yet: two build systems
over one source tree cannot both be right about `import` statements, and a
hand-written `.pbxproj` that references a local SwiftPM package is the most
fragile thing that could live in this directory. Directories carry the layering
for now and no file crosses one; splitting them into real targets is additive.

Swift 6 language mode, `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete`, and
`SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS = YES` on both configurations. There is exactly
one `@unchecked Sendable` in the app (`SessionBox` in `QRScannerView.swift`) and
it exposes two methods AVFoundation documents as callable off the main queue.

## What the running server actually serves — where the documents are wrong

Modelled from a live nine-worktree fleet on 2026-07-22 (`GET /api/state`,
38,615 B; `GET /api/events` snapshot frame), not from `API.md`. Reported here
rather than fixed, per the house rules.

### The wire

| # | claim | what the server does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | IOS-APP.md §3.3 — `background_shell` | the key is **`bg_shell`** (`transcripts.py:953`), and it is present ONLY when true, as is `tool_running` |
| 2 | IOS-APP.md §3.3 — `turnEnded: Bool` | **`turn_ended` is absent from the payload entirely on some sessions** (3 of 36 live). A non-optional `Bool` throws `keyNotFound` and takes the whole 38 KB board with it. This is the single sharpest edge on the wire |
| 3 | IOS-APP.md §3.3 lists `closeoutSentAt` and `cardRev` on `Worktree` | neither string appears anywhere in the server. There is no `card_rev` staleness token |
| 4 | IOS-APP.md §3.3 does not model `pending_bg_tools` | it is on every session and it feeds `busySignal` |
| 5 | task brief: SSE frame is `{type, v, base, at, order, cards, counts, other_procs, freshness}` | `base` is on the **delta** branch only; a snapshot has no `base` |
| 6 | task brief / API.md: `/api/state` is the board snapshot | `/api/state` and the SSE frame are **different shapes**. `/api/state` has `worktrees` (a list), `hostname`, `user`, `free_worktrees`, `resumes`, `generated_at` — and **no `v`, no `order`, no `freshness`**. The frame has `cards` (a dict), `order`, `v`, `freshness` — and none of the four `/api/state`-only terms. `delta_since`'s docstring is the authority and justifies each omission |
| 7 | UX.md §3.1.2 — five-valued `availability` | the server ships the legacy **four** (`free`/`attention`/`waiting`/`busy`). UX.md says so itself: *"a required change to API.md §10.2, not a description of it."* Not landed. `Rules/Triage.swift` derives the split client-side, against principle 3, and says so |
| 8 | UX.md §3.1.3 — `counts: {sessions: {...}, cards: {...}}` | `observer.py:245` writes six flat session-level keys and nothing else. The card tallies the headline needs are derived in `Triage.cardCounts` |
| 9 | UX.md §3.1.4 — the wire carries `activity_at` | it carries **`last_write_at`** (IOS-APP.md §0's alias table has this; UX.md does not) |
| 10 | UX.md §3.1.4 — `topic`/`last_user`/`last_assistant` may live only on a detail route | the live board carries all four prose fields, which is UX.md's own resolution (a). The row is built against that |
| 11 | IOS-APP.md §1.5 — "the server serves HTTPS on the tailnet… no blanket exception is needed" | superseded by ADR 0013: **plain HTTP, no TLS**, `"tls": false` in the pairing response. §1.5's whole ATS paragraph, its `NSExceptionMinimumTLSVersion` and its SPKI pinning are stale |
| 12 | `git.ahead`/`git.behind` | **null, not zero**, when a branch has no upstream — `# branch.ab` is absent from porcelain v2 rather than `+0 -0`. 2 of 9 live worktrees. `↑0` would be a measurement this client never made |
| 13 | `git.commit` | nullable |
| 14 | mutations need `Content-Type: application/json` | undocumented in the alias table; a POST without it is **415 `content_type_required`**, which is the CSRF guard. A Swift client that forgets it gets a status nothing in API.md explains |

### The stream, added in phase 2 — where the documents are further from the wire

Captured from a live `GET /api/events` on 2026-07-22 and decoded frame by frame.

| # | claim | what the server does |
|---|---|---|
| 15 | IOS-APP.md §5.1 — the stream opens with `event: hello` carrying `server_time`, `tick`, `hb`, `collector_ok`, `wake_gap`, `caps`, and repeats them in `event: hb` frames | **none of it exists.** `server._stream` writes exactly two things: `id: <v>` / `event: state` / `data: <envelope>`, and `: keepalive`. There is no hello, no heartbeat frame, no capability list, and no `event: intent`, `event: resync` or `bye`. Everything §5.1 builds on those fields — the derived freshness thresholds, `collector_stuck`, `mac_asleep`, the version gate, the capability matrix — has no trigger on this wire |
| 16 | IOS-APP.md §5.4 / §5.6 — `GET /api/meta` carries `server_time` and `contract` | **404.** `/api/meta`, `/api/hello`, `/api/stats` and `/api/v1/stream` are all 404 today. `observer.delta_since`'s own docstring points at `/api/stats` for `drift`/`sweep_ms`; that route is not in `server.do_GET`'s chain |
| 17 | UX.md §3.13 — the client receives `GET /api/v1/stream?since=<epoch>:<seq>` with field-addressed `ops`, an opaque cursor and a `dg` digest | the wire is `/api/events` with a bare integer version, `Last-Event-ID` as the cursor, and **card-level** deltas. §3.13's own text calls a card-level delta "not a delta"; it is what ships, and on this fleet it measures 7,675 B against a 38,193 B snapshot |
| 18 | the keepalive period is advertised so thresholds can be derived from it | `sse_keepalive_s` is a server config knob and **never reaches the wire**. The client carries the default (25 s) and says so in one place (`FleetStore.keepaliveS`) |
| 19 | a delta's `cards` values are cards | **a value can be `null`, and `null` means the worktree is GONE.** `delta_since` builds `{k: snap.cards.get(k) for k in keys}` over a ring of changed NAMES. Phase 1 modelled it as `[String: Worktree]`, which cannot decode `{"gone": null}` — so the one frame that says a worktree disappeared was the one frame the client threw away |
| 20 | `/api/limits.generated_at` is a timestamp like every other | it is an **ISO-8601 string** (straight out of `cclimits`) and `null` in demo mode, while `/api/state.generated_at` is a **float epoch**. Same key name, two types, on one API. `fetched_at` is the float and is what the "fetched 4m ago" line uses |
| 21 | `/api/chat` reports failure with a status code | it answers **200** with `{"ok": false, "error": "unknown account x"}`. A client trusting the HTTP line renders an empty conversation for a nameable failure |
| 22 | `/api/chat` decodes its query string | `server.do_GET` pulls the account out of the RAW path with `re.search(r"account=([^&]+)")` and never percent-decodes it, so a label containing a space or a `+` could never match `config.account_label`. Latent on this fleet — no label needs escaping — and it is why the client shows the server's refusal verbatim |
| 23 | UX.md §3.2 — `showing 4 of 6` comes from a server `session_count` | there is no such field, so a card truncated at `max_sessions` is indistinguishable from a complete one. The screen says nothing rather than a number it would have to guess |
| 24 | UX.md §3.4 — Activity is a tab | `GET /api/dispatchlog` returns `{"entries": []}` and the intent frames its rows are built from do not exist. The tab is not shipped; the two things it could say today live on the worktree and server screens |

### The mutations, added in phase 3 — where the documents are furthest from the wire

Driven with curl against `100.113.110.31:4269` on 2026-07-22: every refusal below
is a body a real server produced. `UX.md` §7 and `API.md` describe a mutation
contract this server does not have, and the gaps are not cosmetic — two of them
change what the app is allowed to do at all.

| # | claim | what the server does |
|---|---|---|
| 25 | UX.md §7.1 principle 2 — `Idempotency-Key` is *"a precondition for shipping dispatch and finish"*, and both must be **disabled** when the server lacks it | **there is no idempotency anywhere.** `server.do_POST` reads a JSON body, pulls named fields out, calls the module. No header is inspected, no `client_op_id` is stored, `GET /api/intents/{key}` is a 404, and `dispatch._jobs` is an in-memory dict of the last 20 jobs erased by a restart. Two identical `POST /api/dispatch` bodies launch **two** agents — the tmux name embeds `%H%M%S`, so any retry ≥1 s later gets a fresh name. See "the idempotency decision" below |
| 26 | a refusal is an HTTP status | **every mutation answers 200** and puts the outcome in the body as `{"ok": false, "message": …}`. `do_POST` writes `send_response(200)` unconditionally after the module returns. The ONE non-200 is **415 `content_type_required`** for a POST without `Content-Type: application/json`, which is the CSRF guard. A client that branches on the status line sees success for every refusal in the app |
| 27 | UX.md §3.3.2 — `/api/send` takes `expect_sid` and `idempotency_key`, routes through `deliver_text()` + `_proven_in_transcript()`, and returns **202** followed by `{"intent_id", "phase": "typed"/"delivered"/"failed"}` frames on `/api/events` | none of it exists. `/api/send` takes `{account, sid, worktree, text}` (plus an optional `pid` *hint*), types synchronously, and returns `{"ok", "message"}`. `expect_sid` is not read — though its intent IS enforced, inside `identity.resolve`, which re-resolves the address at the instant it types. `_proven_in_transcript` lives in `resume.py` and is called only by the resume daemon. So **`✓✓ delivered` is not available on this wire**, and the app tops out at `✓ typed` |
| 28 | **`ok: true` from `/api/send` means the message was submitted** | **on the Terminal/iTerm2 path it does not.** See "the send that types but does not submit" below — this is the sharpest thing phase 3 found |
| 29 | `ok: false` from `/api/send` means nothing was typed | on the **tmux** path it does not: `ok = rc1 == 0 and rc2 == 0` over two calls, `send-keys -l <text>` then `send-keys Enter`. The second failing leaves the message **in the composer, unsent**, and a retry would duplicate it. `Actuation.outcome(ofSend:)` classifies that as `ambiguous`, never as a clean refusal, and the UI refuses to offer a retry from it |
| 30 | `POST /api/dispatch` has one response shape | it has **two, with no shared field**: `{"job": "job-214849-1"}` on the accepted branch — no `ok` at all — or `{"ok": false, …}` refused. `DispatchStart` is a two-case enum for that reason |
| 31 | UX.md §4.3 — progress is `event: intent` frames off the stream | it is `GET /api/dispatch/status?job=…`, polled. The `①②③④⑤` lines are real and are rendered verbatim. An id the server has forgotten answers `{"ok": false, "error": "unknown job"}`, and it forgets on every restart |
| 32 | `effort_confirmed` is a boolean | **tri-state.** `_run_dispatch` leaves it `None` when no effort was asked for, `False` when `/effort` did not echo `set effort level` into the pane. A `?? false` renders "UNCONFIRMED ⚠" for a case where nothing was attempted |
| 33 | UX.md §4.3 / §7.2 — **Kill** (`POST /api/kill {session}`) is the way to stop an agent dispatched by accident | **`/api/kill` does not exist.** Neither does `/api/pasteboard`. `do_POST`'s whole chain is `reserve · resume/schedule · resume/cancel · send · finish · dispatch` plus the `/api/v1` pairing and device routes. So the app has no undo for a launch, and does not pretend to |
| 34 | ios/README finding 3 — *"`closeoutSentAt` … neither string appears anywhere in the server"* | **wrong, and it was the field phase 3 needed most.** The wire name is `closeout_sent`, written onto the card by `observer.py:228` from `finish._closeouts`, and present only while the card still has a live proc. Its presence IS the two-step state machine: present → `✕ close`, absent → `✓ finish`. Phase 2 checked for the camelCase name from IOS-APP.md and concluded the concept was missing. (`card_rev` genuinely does not exist) |
| 35 | UX.md §4.4 — Finish returns an `intent_id` immediately and phases stream (`fetching → checking → typing → brief_sent`) | it is **one synchronous call** that can exceed 60 s: `git fetch origin` (30 s timeout) + merge-base + `git status` + a full `claude_processes()` scan + osascript (10 s), all inside the request. There is no job id. The app gives it 120 s and shows an honest indeterminate elapsed counter, because a staged label on a call with no phases is a timed fiction |
| 36 | UX.md §4.4's outcome table lists six modes | `start_finish` returns **eight**: the six plus `nudge` (a stalled closeout gets the specifics typed at it) and `chat` (the agent is stuck on a question, so a typed nudge would collide with its open dialog and the user must be routed to chat instead). `mode` is also **absent entirely** on the early refusals — unknown worktree, no trunk ref, demo, and "a live process exists but its terminal can't be scripted" |
| 37 | UX.md §4.4 — `pending` carries an elapsed string | it carries `sent`, an **absolute epoch**, deliberately: an elapsed string computed on the Mac and read on a phone minutes later is dead on arrival. It also carries `left` (a short reason) and `files` (≤5 raw porcelain lines) |
| 38 | `finish._closeouts` survives | in-memory only. A restart drops it, the card stops reporting `closeout_sent`, and the button silently reverts to `✓ finish` — pressing which re-types the whole ~600-character brief at an agent that may be mid-closeout. `ActionsStore` remembers briefs **this phone** sent for 30 minutes and warns when the board stops reporting one while an agent is still live. It cannot see a brief sent from the desktop |
| 39 | resume arming needs an idempotency key | it is idempotent **by construction**: `_resumes` is a dict keyed `"{worktree}\|{sid}"`, so arming twice replaces. Driven twice; one schedule. This is the only mutation in the app with no disable-on-tap, and the only one where a retry is safe |
| 40 | `need_time` is an error | it is a **request for a time** — `{"ok": false, "need_time": true}` means no reset timestamp is known for this limit. The sheet expands its exact-time picker rather than showing a failure |
| 41 | a schedule on `/api/state` matches `ResumeSchedule` as modelled in phase 2 | it also carries `resets_at` and `created_at`, which nothing models yet. Harmless — but note that **schedules ride `/api/state` only**: `resume.py` is not watched by the observer, so arming moves no version and no frame can ever carry it. The app force-refreshes `/api/state` after every arm/disarm, or the sheet says "armed" and the board does not agree for up to 20 s |
| 42 | `GET /api/dispatch/status` validates its query | it matches with `re.search(r"job=([\w-]+)")`, so an empty id silently becomes `{"ok": false, "error": "no job"}` rather than a 400 |
| 43 | `_run_dispatch` cannot strand a job | it has **no `try`/`except`**, so a raise inside it leaves the job at `done: false, result: null` forever. The client's 90 s deadline is the only thing that ends that wait, and it ends it as "did it launch?", never as "failed" |

### The send that types but does not submit — the sharpest defect phase 3 found

`POST /api/send` to a Terminal.app-hosted agent answered:

```json
{"ok": true, "message": "typed into Terminal (ttys008)"}
```

The transcript never grew. Reading the Terminal tab back with AppleScript showed
why:

```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ultracode ─
❯ (orchestra connectivity probe — please ignore, no action needed)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ⏵⏵ bypass permissions on (shift+tab to cycle)
```

**The text was in the composer, unsubmitted.** `_SEND_TERMINAL` uses
`do script "<text>" in t`, which writes the text plus a newline in one burst —
and Claude Code's paste heuristic swallows that newline, exactly the
`[Pasted text #N]` failure that `dispatch.deliver_text` was written to defeat on
the tmux path. The osascript path does not use `deliver_text`. Falsified in both
directions: a subsequent bare `do script "" in t` — a Return with no text —
submitted it immediately.

So on the Terminal path, `ok: true` means *"AppleScript found the tab and wrote
to it"*, not *"the agent received your message"*. Reported, not fixed: it is a
server change (`terminal.send_to_process` needs a second `do script ""`, or the
osascript path needs its own proof-of-submission the way `deliver_text` has one),
and this directory does not touch the Python package.

**It also validates the client's receipt design rather than breaking it.** The app
never claims delivery it cannot see: `✓ typed` is the server's `ok`, and the
second tick is only ever earned by finding the message in the next `/api/chat`
poll. That look is **positive-only** — every one of the five known mismatch paths
(`UX.md` §3.3.2) is a false negative, so a message that is not found is never
reported as missing. On the Terminal probe the app would correctly have stopped
at `✓ typed`.

### The idempotency decision, stated rather than buried

`UX.md` §7.1 principle 2 says dispatch and finish must be **disabled** when the
server has no idempotency key. This server has none, and shipping a phase 3 that
cannot act is not a useful reading of that rule. So this build ships them with the
guard a client can actually enforce, and `Rules/Actuation.swift` names both holes
it cannot close:

| risk | covered? |
|---|---|
| the user taps Launch twice | **yes** — `InFlight` refuses the second, and the action button never re-enables (§7.4) |
| the app auto-retries a POST | **yes** — nothing in this app retries a mutation, ever. `Actuation.mayOfferRetry` returns true for exactly one outcome: a clean server refusal, which proves nothing happened |
| a timeout rendered as failure, and the user re-taps | **yes** — a timeout is `.indeterminate` and reads *"no answer in 90 seconds. A mission may already be running… a retry can start a SECOND agent in the same worktree."* A test asserts no indeterminate copy in the app contains the word "fail" |
| **URLSession retransmits under us** | **no.** Not app-configurable |
| **a second phone, or the desktop board** | **no.** A client-side lock is defeated by two clients — the exact case §7.1 principle 3 warns about |

The two open rows were the server's to close, and it has: `orchestra/idem.py`
persists a boot-tagged reservation write-ahead, so a retry that lands after
`./start.sh` restarted the server is refused rather than re-executed. Both
mutation requests now carry **`Idempotency-Key`** (a fresh client UUID per user
action) and **`Idempotency-Issued-At`** — `Endpoint.freshIdempotency()` mints
them and `urlRequest` sets them. Per tap, never per payload: retrying one action
replays the first answer, while launching the same brief again deliberately is a
second key and a second agent.

### Phase 3: the defect a screenshot found

**The composer sat underneath the connection bar.** Exactly the shape phase 2 hit
with the chat screen's read-only notice — a bottom-pinned control inside a
*pushed* navigation destination does not receive the `safeAreaInset` the tab
applied outside the `NavigationStack`, so it lays itself out against the screen.
Phase 2 dodged it by moving the notice to the top, which works for a caption and
is impossible for a text field. Everything compiled, the transcript rendered
perfectly, and the send button and its "newlines become spaces" footnote were
half-hidden behind `live v78`.

Fixed by **measuring** rather than assuming: `ConnectionBarModifier` reads the
bar's real height with `onGeometryChange` and publishes it as
`EnvironmentValues.bottomAccessoryHeight`; the composer and the worktree screen's
finish footer pad by it. A constant would have been wrong the first time the bar
grew its second line — which it does on every stale board.

### What phase 3 did NOT verify against a live server

Stated rather than implied, because an untested path that looks tested is the
failure this project keeps finding:

- **A real dispatch was never launched.** The refusal paths were driven for real
  (missing model/effort; `needs_decision` with its `can_opus` block), and the
  whole job → poll → terminal-result path was driven end to end using a worktree
  name that does not exist, so `_run_dispatch` ran and failed inside the thread at
  no cost. The success branch is modelled from `_run_dispatch`'s own `finish({…})`
  literal and is decode-tested, not launched.
- **`/api/finish` was driven only to its refusals.** A real closeout types a
  600-character brief at a live agent and can merge and push; step two's UI
  (`✕ close`, the self-clearing `pending` row) is built against `closeout_sent`
  and the `pending`/`chat`/`nudge` bodies, and has not been seen with a brief
  actually outstanding.
- **Arm / disarm was driven by curl, not by a tap.** The sheet renders and its
  fire semantics are stated; the round trip (`armed for 22:49` → visible in
  `/api/state.resumes` → `auto-resume disarmed`) was proven at the HTTP layer.

### ATS, measured rather than assumed

IOS-APP.md §1.5 states *"ATS domain exceptions do not apply to IP-address URLs."*
**On iOS 26 they do**, as an exact `NSExceptionDomains` key. This was not read, it
was falsified: deleting the `100.113.110.31` entry from `Orchestra-Info.plist` and
rebuilding turns the working board into
`NSURLErrorAppTransportSecurityRequiresSecureConnection` (-1022), and putting it
back restores it. The entry is load-bearing and the test that says so can fail.

Both forms are covered, because both are real addresses for the same Mac: `ts.net`
with subdomains for the MagicDNS name, and the raw tailnet IP because
`pairing._server_facts` advertises the address the server is **bound** to — so the
QR hands the phone an IP literal. The IP entry is the one line in this directory
that changes when Tailscale reassigns the address.

`NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` is never set. `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` does not help:
it covers `.local` and link-local, not the `100.64/10` CGNAT range.

## Final verification: the defect the app's own retries were hiding

Found on 2026-07-22 by revoking this phone's device on the real server and then
looking at what the app said. The board emptied — correct, a 401 clears `state`
rather than dimming it — the connection bar said `this device is no longer
paired` for about a second, and then the screen and the bar both settled on:

```
the server said 429
too many failed authentication attempts from 100.113.110.31; try again in 3s
```

`audit.log.jsonl` says why. Thirty refusals in twenty-six seconds, from one
phone, one per second, forever:

```
22:37:36 /api/state   device_revoked
22:37:37 /api/state   device_revoked
22:37:38 /api/state   device_revoked
…
```

`streamLoop` gets this right — `a token problem is not retried`, and it returns.
The **side fetch** was the half still hammering. `pump()` ticks every second and
`refreshSide` guarded on `sideAt`, which was assigned inside the `do` block,
*after* the `await`: only a SUCCESS ever advanced the window, so a fetch that
kept failing re-fired on every tick. That storm spends orchestra's 10/min per-IP
auth budget in about a second, and the 429 that follows overwrites the one
sentence that tells the user what to do. **The client's own retries hid the real
error.**

Two changes, both in `FleetStore`:

* the cadence clock is the last **attempt**, not the last success —
  `beginSideFetch(now:force:)` decides and records in one call, deliberately, so
  the rule and the write cannot drift apart;
* `.unauthorized` is not polled at all, matching the stream. `force` still wins,
  which is the retry arrow and pull-to-refresh.

Three mutations, each watched red: dropping the 401 clause, moving the clock back
onto the success path, and returning the polling period to 1 s. The first version
of the test was a pure predicate over `mayFetchSide` and it **did not catch the
second mutation** — the rule was pinned and the call site was not, which is
exactly the shape of the original defect. That is why `beginSideFetch` exists and
why the second test drives it against a store where nothing succeeds.

Re-driven against the real server with the auth budget drained: **3 refusals in
30 seconds**, and the screen reads

```
🔒 this device isn't paired
device 'iPhone 17 Pro Max' was revoked; pair again to get a new token
```

which is the server's own words and was there the whole time.

**What the same pass confirmed rather than broke.** A clean
`xcodebuild clean && build` with no source warning; 96 headless tests; fourteen
screens screenshotted and looked at, none blank; an untracked file created in
`ConfidAi6` moving the phone from no-Δ to `Δ1 uncommitted` and `v94 → v96` with
no interaction; a server killed mid-stream reading `reconnecting… (2) · showing
data from 6s ago` and then `orchestra isn't running · showing data from 31s ago`,
recovering by itself when the server came back **with its version reset 96 → 1**
(the cursor-ahead branch of `delta_since`, driven by accident and then on
purpose); one socket across background/foreground (`1 → 0 → 1`, same pid) with
`resyncs: 0`; `no upstream` rather than `↑0` on the two detached worktrees whose
`ahead`/`behind` are null; and `tailnet unreachable` distinguished from
`this build cannot reach that address` distinguished from `orchestra isn't
running` — three different failures, three different sentences.

One cosmetic note from the same sweep: the pairing fixture in
`Tests/OrchestraKitTests/DecodeTests.swift` carries a token-shaped string whose
device-id segment collides with a real (long-revoked) device in `devices.json`.
It is synthetic — its sha256 matches nothing in the registry and the live server
answers it 401 — but a fixture that looks like a credential is worth not writing.

## Phase 2: three defects found by RUNNING it, not by reading

All three had the same shape — everything compiled, everything on screen was
correct, and the thing was quietly broken.

**`AsyncLineSequence` drops empty lines, and an empty line is how SSE ends an
event.** The obvious transport is `URLSession.AsyncBytes.lines`. Built that way,
the app held a healthy ESTABLISHED socket, received every byte of every frame,
and **never dispatched one** — the connection strip read `connecting…` forever
while `lsof` on the Mac showed the stream open and the server showed the snapshot
written. `AsyncLineSequence`'s iterator only yields when its buffer is non-empty,
so the blank line between frames is silently swallowed, and in SSE that blank
line is not whitespace, it is the dispatch instruction. Falsified directly
against the live server:

```
A. .lines over the first 3 lines — blank line delivered? false
B. byte-wise: 38229 bytes, 4 lines, 1 blank, in 349 ms
```

Byte-at-a-time over `AsyncBytes` restores the semantics and costs 349 ms per
38 KB frame — an async `next()` per byte. So the transport is a
`URLSessionDataDelegate` handing whole `Data` chunks to `SSELineSplitter`, which
is what `IOS-APP.md` §2.1 says ("delegate-based, deliberately") without saying
why. This is the why.

**`finishTasksAndInvalidate` leaks the socket; the stream needs
`invalidateAndCancel`.** Backgrounding cancels the consuming `Task`, which runs
the `defer` that tears the session down — and `finishTasksAndInvalidate` *waits
for outstanding tasks to finish*, which for a stream is never. Measured with
`lsof -nP -iTCP:4269` across the app's own lifecycle:

```
                    before          after
foreground             1              1
backgrounded           1   ← leak     0
re-foregrounded        2   ← leak     1
after 3 cycles         —              1
```

Every leak burns one of the server's 32 subscriber slots for a client that is not
there, which is the exact failure `stop()` exists to prevent.

**A foreground resume threw its own cursor away.** `resume()` restarts the stream
*and* forces a `/api/state` fetch, so there is always a window where the link is
`.connecting` and a good version is still held. `stream.js` seeds whenever the
stream is not live, and on a browser that is close enough; on a phone it nils the
version (a `/api/state` body carries none), the server answers our
`Last-Event-ID` with a delta, the delta has no base to land on — gap, resync, and
a full 38 KB snapshot for a resume that should have cost one delta. The
diagnostics screen is what showed it: `resyncs: 1` after three
background/foreground cycles, `0` after the fix. The rule is now a pure function,
`FleetStore.maySeed`, and the mutation that restores `stream.js`'s simpler
version is caught by a test.

And two more that only a screenshot could have found, both on views that
compiled, rendered, and were wrong: a dark vertical seam down the right edge of
every session row (a `.background` on the disclosure chevron covers the glyph's
own height, and the canvas shows through above and below it), and the chat
screen's read-only notice sitting UNDER the connection bar (a bottom-pinned row
inside a **pushed** navigation destination does not receive the `safeAreaInset`
the tab applied outside the `NavigationStack` — two attempts to fix it in place
failed the same way, so the notice moved to the top, where it is read anyway).

## Phase 1: two defects found by looking, not by reading

Both are the shape METHOD.md is about — everything on screen was correct.

**The second-launch bug.** The app paired against the real server, drew the real
board, and came back to the pairing screen on the next launch. A target built
with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED = NO` carries no entitlements, so it has no keychain
access group and `SecItemAdd` answers `errSecMissingEntitlement`. The token was
never written; only the *second* launch could see it. Fixed with ad-hoc signing
(`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "-"`) plus `Orchestra.entitlements`, and verified by
pairing, terminating, relaunching with no seam, and watching the board come back.

**Every pid had a decimal point in it.** `Text("\(n)")` resolves to the
`LocalizedStringKey` overload, which formats the interpolated integer through the
locale — pid `34115` rendered as `34.115`. A pid is an identifier, not a
quantity, and neither is a commit count in a mono column. Every numeric literal
in the UI is now `Text(verbatim:)`.

## Measured, driving the real fleet

* **A `touch` on a watched transcript reached the phone in 1.27 s** — touch at
  `1784748313.813`, `delta v=72 base=71 cards=['ConfidAI2']` on the wire at
  `1784748315.081`. The board's two session rows swapped (the server re-sorts by
  freshness) and the top row went `19m` → `3s` with no interaction, no
  pull-to-refresh and no poll.
* **A live agent's own write did the same**, unprompted: `v73 → v74`, one card,
  `17m` → `28s` on screen.
* **A delta is 7,675 B against a 38,193 B snapshot** on this nine-worktree fleet
  — 20 %, and it carries one card out of nine.
* **Not every write is fast.** A touch on an older transcript on the same card
  produced nothing for 16 s, then arrived on the ordinary sweep. The ~1 s figure
  is the kqueue-watched path; a file the watcher is not holding an fd for falls
  back to the cadence. Worth knowing before promising "~1 s" as a flat number.

## Open, and deliberately not done in this phase

- **The Activity tab.** See wire finding 24: no data source exists. Phase 3 makes
  this more visible rather than less — a dispatch is now startable from the phone
  and its history lives only in `ActionsStore` for as long as the app is alive.
  `GET /api/dispatchlog` returns `{"entries": []}` on this fleet.
- **Kill.** There is no endpoint (finding 33), so there is no way to stop a
  mission from the phone. The launch confirmation says so rather than promising an
  undo that does not exist.
- **`force_model` was never exercised against a real reserve.** The sheet exists
  and is wired; the only `needs_decision` reachable without spending was a
  nonexistent account, whose `can_opus` was false.
- **Draft persistence.** `UX.md` §3.5 wants the mission draft in the App Group on
  a 500 ms debounce, surviving app kill. It lives in `@State` today, so a
  dismissed composer loses its text.
- **Share extension, `orchestra://mission?text=`, Live Activities.** All of §3.5
  and §8.3's surfaces are additive and none is load-bearing.
- **The branch map** (`UX.md` §5) and `/api/topology`.
- **Clock skew.** Every relative label is `device now` minus a server instant, and
  nothing corrects for skew. `IOS-APP.md` §5.4 samples it from
  `/api/meta.server_time`, which is a 404; `/api/health.time` is the one honest
  source on this server and wiring it is additive.
- **Push.** No APNs key exists and only the account holder can make one. Nothing
  here is load-bearing on it: it lands as a registration call and a delegate.
- **Real modules.** See "Shape".
- **The Asset Catalog.** `Palette` resolves all four variants of every token in
  one `UIColor(dynamicProvider:)`, which keeps UX.md §9.1's actual property (no
  ternary at any call site, so Contrast+ cannot be applied 60 %). A catalog is
  still the better home because it reaches widgets and notification content,
  which render out of process.
- ~~**IBM Plex Mono.**~~ **Done** — four faces bundled in `App/Fonts/`, Bold Text
  resolved from `\.legibilityWeight`, and the per-glyph failure §9.4 warns about
  closed by a whole-face guard and a coverage test. See "Shape". No call site
  changed, exactly as this entry predicted.
- **A device build.** Simulator only. A real device needs a team in a gitignored
  `Signing.xcconfig`; that is the one thing here that needs the paid account.

## Phase 4 — push

Registration, per-event preferences, deep links, and inline reply from the
banner. The server pipeline (`push.py`, `notify.py`) shipped in phase 2; this is
the phone half.

### What it does

* **Registration.** On first pair the app asks for authorization
  (`.alert/.sound/.badge`), registers for a remote token, and POSTs it to
  `/api/v1/devices/self/push` with the environment (read from the embedded
  provisioning profile's `aps-environment`, `sandbox` on a simulator), the
  device's tz offset, and the app version. It re-registers on foreground —
  cheap, and it is how a rotated token and a moved timezone reach the server,
  since iOS gives no background callback for either. `PushStore` is pure (no
  UIKit); `PushController` is the `UNUserNotificationCenter` adapter.
* **Inline reply — the point of the feature.** The `ORC_REPLY` category carries a
  `UNTextInputNotificationAction`; answering it calls `/api/send` addressed by
  **`sid` alone**. The payload never carried an account and does not need one:
  `identity.resolve` resolves a bare sid to the live process. Not `.foreground` —
  the whole value is answering without opening the app.
* **Deep links.** A tap deposits a `PushDeepLink` in `PushRouter`; `RootView`
  selects the Fleet tab and `FleetView` resolves the account (absent from the
  payload) from the live board by sid and pushes the exact conversation. The
  link is HELD while the board loads, so a cold-launch tap still lands on the
  chat rather than settling for the board.
* **Preferences.** `NotificationSettingsView` (reached from the Server tab) edits
  per-event rules, quiet hours, privacy and the nudge interval, and writes
  `/api/v1/devices/self/settings`. Defaults mirror `EVENT_TYPES[…]["default"]`
  exactly — your-turn, auto-resume-armed and worktree-freed are OFF, pinned by a
  test.

### Drive it without a finger — the `#if DEBUG` seams

A simulator cannot tap a permission dialog, a notification banner, or a reply
field, so — exactly like `ORC_SEND`/`ORC_SCREEN` — each path has a seam that
presses the same button the OS presses, through the same `PushStore` /
`PushController` the delegate uses.

```sh
# 1. registration reaches the server (synthetic token, real POST)
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_PUSH_TOKEN=$(python3 -c "print('facefeed'*8)") \
  xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
#   → devices.json gains push.{token,environment:sandbox,tz_offset_min,app_version}

# 2. a tap deep-links to the exact session
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_PUSH='{"ev":"session.needs_answer","wt":"ConfidAI2",
  "sid":"<sid>","level":"P1","aps":{"alert":{"title":"…","subtitle":"…"}}}' \
  xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
#   → lands on that session's ChatView

# 3. an inline reply reaches the agent, by sid alone
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_PUSH='{…same…}' \
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_PUSH_ACTION=reply \
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_PUSH_REPLY='yes, ship it' \
  xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
#   → POST /api/send {sid,text}; server types into the live terminal

# the preferences screen, and provisional auth so a launch does not stall on the prompt
SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_PUSH_PROVISIONAL=1 SIMCTL_CHILD_ORC_SCREEN=notifications \
  xcrun simctl launch booted sh.orchestra.app
```

### Where the documents and the server disagree — reported, per METHOD §4

Modelled from a live `notify.compose` and driven against `100.113.110.31:4269`
on 2026-07-23.

| # | claim | what the server does |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | the payload carries a `category`, or `API.md` §9.23's `expect_sid`/`intent_id`/`phase` | `notify.compose` emits **none of them**. The `aps` has `alert`, `interruption-level`, `thread-id`, `mutable-content:1`, `content-available:1`, `sound`; the body has `ev`, `event_id`, `dedupe_key`, `at`, `wt`, `sid`, `level`, `counts`. **No `category`** — and iOS decides the inline-reply field from `aps.category` at delivery. So the app DERIVES it (`PushMessage.categoryID` → `ORC_REPLY` for `needs_answer`/`blocked`, else `ORC_INFO`) and it must be STAMPED onto the notification before the banner shows: by the notification-service extension (`mutable-content:1` is set for exactly this) or by a one-line server addition (`aps["category"]`). Until one of those lands, a real push shows no reply button. The app half is complete and drives correctly for any payload carrying the category. |
| P2 | the push payload carries an account for the reply | it carries `sid` and `wt`, **never an account**. Inline reply is `POST /api/send {sid, text}` (worktree as a free corroborator); `identity.resolve` resolves the bare sid. Driven live: `{"ok": true, "message": "typed into Terminal (ttys010)"}`. |
| P3 | a device can read back its stored preferences | **no route returns them.** `GET /api/v1/push/status` answers the pipeline's health and a `registered` bool — nothing about rules or quiet hours. The settings screen opens on the app's **local mirror** of the last save and says so; every save POSTs the full set and adopts the server's echo. |
| P4 | `/api/v1/devices/self/push` is device-self-service on every running server | a server that PREDATES the `SELF_SUBTREE` auth fix refuses it **403 `admin_local_only`** to any token (observed on a server started before the fix; a restart cleared it). The app maps 403 → a registration failure carrying the server's own sentence, so a stale server is diagnosable rather than a silent dead token. |
| P5 | `/api/v1/push/test` answers `{ok, message}` | it answers `{ok, backend, status, apns_id, reason, environment, message, health}`. The app reads `message` — e.g. `"no answer · apns_key_path is not set — the .p8 auth key file…"`, a working transport naming the one missing credential. |
| P6 | `/api/v1/push/status` names a missing key as `"no APNs key configured"` | the live sink is more specific: `"apns_key_path is not set — the .p8 auth key file downloaded from developer.apple.com"`. The app shows whatever `problems[]` says, verbatim. |

### What only a device — or a key — can add, and what a simulator cannot show

- **Apple's own delivery.** No `.p8` exists (only the account holder can make
  one — `docs/mobile/APNS-SETUP.md`), so `/push/test` correctly stops at "no
  key". Everything up to Apple accepting the token is proven.
- **A real remote token.** The simulator's `registerForRemoteNotifications` does
  not mint one here; registration was proven with a synthetic token through the
  identical `PushStore.register` path, stored by the server. A device build needs
  the `aps-environment` entitlement and the Push Notifications capability, which
  ride the provisioning profile — the paid-account items, gated exactly like the
  device-signing note above. They are deliberately NOT in the shared
  `Orchestra.entitlements`, because an `aps-environment` entitlement breaks the
  ad-hoc simulator signing this repo builds with.
- **The banner presentation itself.** `xcrun simctl push` delivers the payload,
  but iOS suppresses PRESENTATION until notification authorization is granted —
  and on the iOS 26 simulator that cannot be scripted: the authorization prompt
  appears even for `.provisional`, and the Simulator exposes no accessible window
  to tap "Allow" (no `idb`/`cliclick`, System Events sees zero windows). This is
  the same wall the `ORC_*` seams exist to climb, so the notification-handling
  path — deep link and inline reply — is driven through the delegate's own code
  by the seams above and verified against the real server, which proves
  everything except the pixels of the banner. The authorization request itself is
  screenshotted (the real system prompt fires on launch).

### Not done, and honest about it

- **The notification-service extension.** `IOS-APP.md` §1.2 lists
  `OrchestraNotificationService`; it is the sanctioned home for stamping the
  `ORC_REPLY` category onto a payload (finding P1) and for enriching a
  `structural` body from `/api/v1/events/<id>` over the tailnet. It is a new
  Xcode target — a hand-edited `.pbxproj`, the most fragile change in this
  directory (`Package.swift`) — and it is additive, so it is left for its own
  step rather than risked against a green build whose gate is "xcodebuild
  succeeds". The app registers the category and handles the reply today; the
  extension (or the one-line server `aps["category"]`) is what makes the reply
  field appear on a production push.
- **A settings read-back route, quiet-hours DST correctness beyond the offset,
  and the widget / Live Activity surfaces of `IOS-APP.md` §1.2** — all additive.
