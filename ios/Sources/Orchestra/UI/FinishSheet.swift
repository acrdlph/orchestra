/// 6-second `_armFinish` window on one client; that cannot survive a second
/// phone, a notification action, or an app relaunch, and two clients holding
/// their own arm windows desynchronise instantly.
///
/// **What the server actually publishes is one field:** `closeout_sent`, an epoch
/// on the card, copied from `finish._closeouts` by `observer.py:228` and present
/// only while the card still has a live process. Present → this is step two,
/// `✕ Close`. Absent → step one, `✓ Finish`. There is no phase stream, no
/// `intent_id`, and no `armed` state on the wire — `UX.md` §4.4's *"Finish
/// returns an `intent_id` immediately and phases stream"* describes a server that
/// does not exist. So the two steps are made legible the only honest way
/// available: **two visually different sheets with different words, different
/// heights and different buttons**, so a tap in step two can never be muscle
/// memory from step one.
