/// this" — it means "what you are looking at is four minutes old", and the
/// board's own content is still the most useful thing on the display.
///
/// **The rule the copy has to get right** (IOS-APP.md §5.5): *ages keep ticking
/// while stale; statuses dim.* An age derives from an absolute transcript write
/// stamp, so "8 m ago" stays literally true with a dead stream and degrades in
/// the safe direction — counting up towards "we don't know". A `● WORKING`
/// badge on a four-minute-old snapshot is a lie, so the board behind this bar is
/// dimmed while it shows anything but `live`.

/// bottom-pinned control inside a *pushed* destination does not receive that
/// inset — it lays itself out against the screen and ends up underneath the bar.
/// Phase 2 hit it with the chat screen's read-only notice and dodged it by moving
/// the notice to the top, which is fine for a caption and impossible for a
/// composer: a text field belongs above the keyboard, at the bottom, or nowhere.
///
/// So the height is measured where the bar is actually laid out and handed down
/// the environment, and any bottom-pinned control in a pushed screen pads by it.
/// One value, one writer, and it is a real measurement rather than a constant
/// that goes stale the first time the bar grows a second line — which it does,
/// on every stale board.
