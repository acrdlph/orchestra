/// site. The catalog is the better long-term home (it reaches widgets and
/// notification content, which run out of process); this is the version that
/// does not need twenty-odd JSON directories to compile.
///
/// Ratios in the comments are WCAG 2.x relative luminance with sRGB alpha
/// compositing, taken from `UX.md` §9.2 where they were computed.
