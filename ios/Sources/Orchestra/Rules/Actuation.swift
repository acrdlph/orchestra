/// shipping dispatch and finish"* and says both actions must be **disabled**
/// when the server lacks it. That was written against a planned server. The one
/// that exists was driven end to end on 2026-07-22 and there is no key anywhere:
/// `server.do_POST` reads a JSON body, pulls named fields out of it, and calls
/// the module. No header is inspected, no `client_op_id` is stored, `/api/intents`
/// is a 404, and `dispatch._jobs` is an in-memory dict of the last 20 jobs that a
/// restart erases. `POST /api/dispatch` twice with the same body launches **two**
/// agents — the tmux session name embeds `%H%M%S`, so any retry one second later
/// gets a fresh name and a fresh agent.
///
/// Disabling dispatch and finish entirely would ship a phase 3 that cannot act,
/// so this build takes the other honest option: **ship them with the guard the
/// client can actually enforce, and be loud about the two holes it cannot
/// close.**
///
/// | risk | covered here? |
/// |---|---|
/// | the user taps Launch twice | yes — `InFlight` refuses the second, and the button never re-enables (§7.4) |
/// | the app auto-retries a POST | yes — nothing in this app retries a mutation, ever |
/// | a timeout is rendered as failure and the user re-taps | yes — a timeout is `.indeterminate`, and `.indeterminate` never offers a retry |
/// | **URLSession retransmits under us** | **no.** Not app-configurable. A POST whose connection dies before any response byte arrives may be replayed on a fresh connection |
/// | **a second phone, or the desktop board** | **no.** A client-side lock is defeated by two clients, which is the exact case it was written for (§7.1 principle 3) |
