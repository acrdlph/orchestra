// The board payload, modelled from a LIVE server rather than from API.md.
//
// Captured 2026-07-22 from `GET /api/state` on a real nine-worktree fleet
// (38,615 bytes, 9 worktrees, 36 sessions, 4 live procs, 5 other procs) and
// cross-checked against `GET /api/events`'s snapshot frame. Every optionality
// below is a fact about that capture or about the code that writes it, and the
// ones that differ from the document are listed in `ios/README.md`.
//
// Re-shaped 2026-08-06 for ADR 0016 (the collector split): a card's identity is
// the qualified key `<node>/<worktree>` — two machines can each hold a
// `ConfidAI2`, so the bare name stopped being one. Cards carry `node`, the
// payload carries a `nodes` map and the board host's own `node` id, and every
// single string that names a card on the wire (`free_worktrees`, `order`, frame
// `cards` keys, `resumes` keys, the `worktree` parameter of every acting route)
// is that key. `observer.merge_nodes` is the authority; `docs/mobile/NODES.md`
// is the design.
//
// Two rules hold everywhere in this file:
//
//   1. **A field the server omits is `Optional` in Swift, not defaulted at the
//      decoder.** `turn_ended` is written by `transcripts.py` only on the path
//      that computed it — 33 of 36 live sessions carried it, 3 did not — and a
//      non-optional `Bool` there throws `keyNotFound` and takes the whole board
//      with it.
//   2. **A field the server can write as `null` is `Optional` even when it is
//      always present.** `git.ahead`/`git.behind` are absent-as-null whenever a
//      branch has no upstream: 2 of 9 live worktrees, and `↑null` is not a
//      thing the row can render.

/// `GET /api/state`.
///
/// Note what is NOT here and rides only on `GET /api/events`: `v` (the version),
/// `order` (the board's triage order) and `freshness`. And what rides only here:
/// `hostname`, `user`, `free_worktrees`, `resumes`, and `node` (the board host's
/// own node id). The two payloads are deliberately different shapes —
/// `observer.delta_since`'s docstring is the authority and it says why for each
