// Push, modelled from what the SERVER actually emits — `notify.compose` in the
// Python package, read field by field, not from API.md §9.23 (which describes a
// payload with `expect_sid`, an `intent_id` and a `phase`, none of which ride
// this wire). Every shape here is decode-tested against a literal copy of a
// `compose` payload in `PushTests`.
//
// The one thing `compose` does NOT put on the wire is a `category`, and inline
// reply cannot exist without one: iOS decides whether to hang a text field on a
// banner from `aps.category`, at delivery, before the user touches it. So the
// category is DERIVED here from `ev`/`level` — a pure function of the payload —
// and stamped onto the notification by the service extension (`mutable-content:
// 1` is set by `compose` for exactly this) or, failing that, carried in the
// payload directly. Where it comes from is a transport detail; what it must be
// is `PushMessage.categoryID`, and that is decided here so one rule serves the
// banner, the extension and the tests.
