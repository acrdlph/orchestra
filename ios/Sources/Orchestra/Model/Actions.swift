// The four mutations, modelled from a LIVE server on 2026-07-22 rather than from
// API.md or UX.md §7 — both of which describe a contract this server does not
// have. Every shape below was produced by an actual request against
// `100.113.110.31:4269` and is quoted in `ios/README.md`'s findings table.
//
// **The single most important fact about this file: a refusal is HTTP 200.**
//
//     POST /api/send     {"pid": 93506, "text": "x"}
//     → 200 {"ok": false, "error": "unaddressed", "message": "refusing to act…"}
//
//     POST /api/dispatch {"mission": "probe"}
//     → 200 {"ok": false, "message": "pick a model and an effort first…"}
//
//     POST /api/finish   {"worktree": "nope"}
//     → 200 {"ok": false, "message": "unknown worktree 'nope'"}
//
// `server.do_POST` builds the body from the module's return value and then
// writes `send_response(200)` unconditionally. The ONE status that is not 200 is
// **415 `content_type_required`** for a POST without `Content-Type:
// application/json`, which is the CSRF guard. So a client that branches on the
// status line sees success for every refusal in the app, and the `ok` field is
// the status.

/// The common shape of a mutation's answer: `{"ok": …, "message": …}`, plus the
/// machine-readable `error` code the identity guard adds.
///
/// `message` is carried verbatim to the screen and is never replaced with a
/// generic string. These messages are the whole UX of a refusal — *"refusing to
/// act on pid 93506 alone — pids are recycled, so a bare pid can name a
/// different agent by the time the click lands (ADR 0008)"* is a sentence a
