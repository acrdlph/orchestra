// The branch map's data, modelled from the LIVE server rather than from the docs.
//
// `UX.md` §5.3 and `API.md` §9.7 describe a `GET /api/v1/topology` that ships
// `worktree_id`, `subject_short`, `base_ts`, `dropped[]`, an `axis` block with
// `s`/`anchor_age_s`, a `role`, and `_at` timestamp spellings. **None of that
// endpoint exists.** Decoded live on 2026-07-23 from `GET /api/topology` — the
// only topology route `server.py` serves (`server.py:335`) — against the real
// nine-worktree fleet, the payload is the LEGACY shape `gitrepo.branch_topology`
// writes:
//
//   * top level `generated_at` (not `at`/`fetched_at`/`epoch`/`seq`)
//   * groups carry `repo`, `base`, `trunk_ts`, `trunk_commits`, `branches`
//   * a branch carries `worktree` (the name, not a `worktree_id`), `branch`,
//     `fork_ts`/`tip_ts` (the `_ts` spelling, not `_at`), `ahead`, `behind`,
//     `dirty`, `hash`, `subject` (UNTRUNCATED — `subject_short` is never
//     written), and `commits` (epoch seconds, newest first, capped 40) —
//     and, since ADR 0016, `node`: the map joins the board by the derived
//     branch key `<node>/<worktree>`, because same-repo worktrees from two
//     machines share a trunk group by origin URL
//   * there is NO `dropped[]`, NO per-branch `base_ts`, NO `axis`, NO `role`
//
// The consequences for this build, each honest rather than papered over:
//
//   1. The axis scalars (`s`, `anchor_age_s`) are not on the wire, so the client
//      derives the clamped per-group anchor from the fork set itself. §5.3's ⚠
//      note says exactly this is possible; its "client and server never disagree"
//      guarantee is then vacuous, which is fine — there is one computer deciding
//      the axis, so there is nobody to disagree with. See `BranchMap.axis`.
//   2. `role` is derived client-side from `ahead`/`behind` — §5.6 says it is
//      derivable and the server does not ship it, so this is the only path.
//   3. `subject` arrives untruncated; the row truncates once, at draw time.
//   4. The stale-`behind` marker of §5.8 has NO input — `base_ts` is computed
//      server-side (`gitrepo.py:205`) and dropped before serialisation — so it
//      cannot be drawn, and this build does not pretend to. Noted in `ios/README`.
//   5. Dropped worktrees are surfaced by DIFFERENCE against the board's worktree
//      list, not read from a `dropped[]` the server never sends (§5.10 unmapped).
