/// `deliver_text()` and `_proven_in_transcript()`, then `phase` frames on the
/// event stream. Driven against the real server, none of that exists on this
/// path — `send_to_process` types with `tmux send-keys` or osascript and returns
/// `{"ok": …, "message": …}` synchronously; `_proven_in_transcript` lives in
/// `resume.py` and is called only by the resume daemon; and `server._stream`
/// writes `event: state` and nothing else, so there is no intent frame to carry a
/// phase.
///
/// So the strongest honest receipt is **`✓ typed` — the keystrokes were
/// accepted**, which is exactly what `ok: true` has always meant. The client then
/// looks for the message in the next transcript poll and, if it finds it, upgrades
/// to `✓✓ in the transcript`. That look is **positive-only**: not finding it
/// upgrades nothing and warns about nothing, because all five known mismatch
/// paths are false negatives (see `WireText.matches`).
